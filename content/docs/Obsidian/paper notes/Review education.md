Peterson and Brown (2005) made a substantial contribution to this literature by examining the relationship between standardized regression coefficients (b) and correlation coefficients (r). Within a sample of over 1,500 studies in the social sciences, they found that *b and r are extremely highly correlated (r = .84)*, and the number of independent variables in a regression equation was not related to the divergence between b and r. In other words, b corresponds to r quite well *regardless of the number of covariates in the regression equation*, so the use of different covariates across studies does not seem to systematically affect the estimate of b. Peterson and Brown also compared the utility of several equations that conveyed the relationship between b and r; their analyses showed that the straightforward equation b = r performed as well as any other equation, particularly when betas were fairly close to zero (as they often are in higher education research). Thus, **standardized beta coefficients can be substituted directly for correlation coefficients in a quantitative meta-analysis** (Borenstein et al. 2009; Rosenthal and DiMatteo 2001).

### Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a long preclinical period and diverse progression across individuals. A plethora of neuroimaging studies has found the presence of AD-related pathologies, such as amyloid-␤ (A␤) deposition and pathological tau, among cognitively normal individuals, which begins years before the emergence of  the clinical symptom of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this regard, AD is defined by its underlying pathologic processes that can be documented by postmortem examination or in vivo by biomarkers. In general, the biomarkers are grouped into A␤ deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration.  A major challenge in the care and management of AD is the paradoxical relationship between the burden of AD pathology and its clinical outcome. Converging evidence shows that the individual’s neurodegeneration trajectory is not only regulated by the abnormal deposition of pathology burden but also moderated by the brain’s capability to maintain normal cognition. In this regard, the concept of resilience has been introduced into the field of neuroscience, acting as a moderate factor to preserve normal cognition despite underlying neuropathology. These individual differences could be explained by higher capital (higher to start with), better maintenance (slower decline trend), or greater resilience and compensation capacities. For example, the most frequently used tests for AD diagnosis include verbal memory for the word list, story, and other verbal materials. There is a lifelong female advantage in verbal memory that sustains until reaching amnestic MCI . The downside is that such a female advantage is eliminated at higher levels of pathology burden, resulting in delayed MCI diagnosis at the cost of a more severe burden of disease at the time of diagnosis and decline rapidly, and eventually missing the window for early intervention.  阿尔茨海默病（Alzheimer's disease，AD）是一种常见的神经退行性疾病，临床前期时间长，个体间进展差异大。大量的神经影像学研究发现，在认知正常的个体中存在AD相关的病理，如淀粉样蛋白（A）沉积和病理性tau蛋白，这些病理在轻度认知障碍（MCI）的临床症状出现前数年就开始了。在这方面，AD由其潜在的病理过程定义，这些病理过程可通过尸检或体内生物标志物记录。一般而言，生物标志物分为A β沉积、病理性tau蛋白和神经变性。AD的护理和管理面临的主要挑战是**AD病理负担与其临床结局之间的矛盾关系**。越来越多的证据表明，个体的神经退行性变轨迹不仅受到病理负荷异常沉积的调节，而且还受到大脑维持正常认知能力的调节。在这方面，弹性的概念已被引入神经科学领域，作为一个温和的因素，以保持正常的认知，尽管潜在的神经病理学。这些个体差异可以用较高的资本（开始时较高）、较好的维持（下降趋势较慢）或较强的复原力和补偿能力来解释。例如，AD诊断中最常用的测试包括单词表、故事和其他语言材料的语言记忆。女性在语言记忆方面具有终生的优势，这种优势一直持续到遗忘型MCI。不利的一面是，这种女性优势在病理负担水平较高时被消除，导致MCI诊断延迟，代价是诊断时疾病负担更重并迅速下降，最终错过早期干预的窗口期。Most people with AD have the late-onset form of the disease, i.e., symptoms become apparent in their mid-60s and later. Although no specific gene has been identified as having a direct cause on lateonset AD, a number of generic risk factors have been found to be associated with AD. For example, 11 novel susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in a meta-analysis ofgenomewide association studies (GWAS) that recruited over 74,046 individuals with and without late-onset AD. Since each ofthe identified genetic variants has a small effect size, polygenetic risk scores (PRSs) have been widely used as a predictor in many AD studies, which combine the effects of many individual SNPs. For example, AD PRS showed promising results in detecting MCI in adults who were only in their 50s. Although tremendous strides have been made in studying genetic associations in AD, limited attention has been given to investigate the role of genetic factors in cognitive reserve.  大多数患有AD的人具有该疾病的迟发型，即，症状在他们60多岁中期和以后变得明显。虽然没有特异性基因被鉴定为对迟发性AD具有直接原因，但已发现许多一般性风险因素与AD相关。例如，在一项全基因组关联研究（GWAS）的荟萃分析中发现了11个新的易感性单核苷酸多态性（SNPs），该研究招募了超过74,046名患有和未患有迟发性AD的个体。由于每一个已鉴定的遗传变异都有一个小的效应量，多基因风险评分（PRSs）已被广泛用作许多AD研究的预测因子，它联合收割机了许多单个SNPs的效应。例如，AD PRS在50多岁的成年人中检测MCI显示出有希望的结果。虽然在研究AD的遗传相关性方面取得了巨大的进展，但对遗传因素在认知储备中的作用的研究却很少。Besides aging and biology factors, socioeconomic status (SES) such as education and occupation also have a significant role in regulating the progression of AD. In an early longitudinal study of 593 nondemented individuals aged 60 years or older, the follow-up examining results showed that increased education and occupational attainment might reduce the risk of AD . Furthermore, lifestyle, physical illness, health care, and environmental factors associated with poverty are considered as other possible reasons for diminishing the brain’s reserve ofpersons with AD.  除年龄和生物学因素外，社会经济地位（SES）如教育和职业也在调节AD的进展中起重要作用。早期对593例60岁以上非痴呆患者的纵向研究表明，提高教育水平和职业素养可降低AD的发病风险。此外，生活方式、身体疾病、医疗保健和与贫困相关的环境因素被认为是AD患者大脑储备减少的其他可能原因。Although the concept ofcognitive reserve has been put forward to account for the individual difference of cognitive decline in the neuroscience field, many pathology studies are more likely to attribute the reason for such difference to the limitation of current pathology technology. However, there is one common agreement across the AD research community that the lack of direct measurement of cognitive reserve makes it difficult to quantify the degree of individual differences in susceptibility to age-related brain changes and pathologic changes in AD. To address this challenge, we propose a novel statistical approach to *define an operational proxy* of the cognitive reserve *by quantifying longitudinal clinical phenotypic expression* in relation to the underlying neurodegenerative processes on an individual basis. We demonstrate the rationale of our approach in Fig. 1, where we analogize the complementary role between pathology assay technology (hardware) and computational resilience proxy (software) to the technology of optical zoom and digital zoom function  in computer vision. In this regard, the major contribution of our work is a novel operational definition of cognitive reserve that can improve the precision of measuring pathological burden and disentangle the variable relationships between neuropathological substrates and clinical outcomes.  虽然神经科学领域提出了认知储备的概念来解释认知下降的个体差异，但许多病理学研究更倾向于将这种差异的原因归结为现有病理学技术的局限性。然而，AD研究界有一个共同的共识，即*缺乏对认知储备的直接测量*使得难以量化AD中年龄相关脑变化和病理变化易感性的个体差异程度。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种新的统计学方法，**通过量化个体基础上与潜在神经退行性变过程相关的纵向临床表型表达，来定义认知储备的操作代理**。我们在图1中展示了我们方法的基本原理，其中我们类比了病理学检测技术（硬件）和计算弹性代理（软件）与计算机视觉中光学变焦和数字变焦功能技术之间的互补作用。在这方面，我们工作的主要贡献是认知储备的一个新的操作定义，它可以提高测量病理负担的精确度，并解开神经病理学底物和临床结果之间的变量关系。

As the digital zoom is a complementary technique to achieve super-resolution beyond optical zoom, our computational model allows us to quantify an individual’s brain resilience using the current pathology technology and sets the stage for precision medicine.  To do so, we *first* present a *regression* model to investigate the cognitive reserve proxy, where the ==*response is the diagnosis label*== (indicating the severity of AD progression), and the *predictors include age, sex, pathology burden, education, AD PRS, and their interactions*. Our hypothesis is that the pathophysiology of AD is defined by AD-specific biological changes. However, the progression of AD is also moderated by socioeconomic factors such as education. In this context, **we conceptualize the mechanism of the cognitive reserve as a joint product of AD pathology (measured by tau/A␤42 ratio) and socioeconomic factors** (measured by educational level), where their counteracting effect size of moderating the cognitive decline can be used as the computational proxy of cognitive reserve. Given the new proxy of cognitive reserve, we further investigate the following two hypotheses: 1) Does the high education group have a higher cognitive reserve to AD pathology? 2) Does a high level of education have the same downside as a female advantage in AD progression in the way of a more rapid cognitive decline after going beyond the moderate level of pathology? We perform significant testing in our regression model to test the first hypothesis. Regarding the second hypothesis, we employ a Cox model on the longitudinal data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database to examine the influence of cognitive reserve across educational differences.  由于数码变焦是实现光学变焦以外的超分辨率的补充技术，我们的计算模型允许我们使用当前的病理学技术量化个体的大脑弹性，并为精准医疗奠定了基础。为此，我们首先提出了一个回归模型来研究认知储备代理，其中反应是诊断标签（指示AD进展的严重程度），预测因素包括年龄、性别、病理负担、教育、AD PRS及其相互作用。我们的假设是AD的病理生理学是由AD特异性的生物学改变定义的。然而，AD的进展也受到社会经济因素（如教育）的调节。在此背景下，我们将认知储备的机制概念化为AD病理学（通过tau/A42比值测量）和社会经济因素（通过教育水平测量）的联合产物，其中它们调节认知下降的抵消效应大小可用作认知储备的计算代理。鉴于认知储备这一新的替代物，我们进一步研究了以下两个假设：1）高学历组对AD病理是否有更高的认知储备？2)在AD进展中，高教育水平是否与女性优势具有相同的缺点，即在超过中度病理水平后认知功能下降更快？我们在回归模型中进行显著性检验以检验第一个假设。对于第二个假设，我们采用Cox模型对阿尔茨海默病神经影像学倡议（ADNI）数据库的纵向数据进行分析，以检验认知储备在教育差异中的影响。

### Methods
The data used in our study were obtained from the **ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) database** (https://ida.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator MichaelW.Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. For up-to-date information, see https://www.adni-info.org. There are four phases of the ADNI study (ADNI1, ADNI-GO, ADNI2, and  ADNI3). Some participants were carried forward from previous phases for continued monitoring, while new participants were added with each phase to further investigate the evolution of AD. 本研究中使用的数据来自ADNI数据库（https：ida.loni.usc.edu）。ADNI于2003年启动，作为一个公私合作伙伴关系，由首席研究员MichaelW.Weiner，MD领导。ADNI的主要目的是检验是否可以将连续磁共振成像（MRI）、正电子发射断层扫描（PET）、其他生物学标记物以及临床和神经心理学评估结合起来，以测量MCI和早期AD的进展。有关最新信息，请参见https://www.adni-info.org。ADNI研究分为四个阶段（ADNI 1、ADNI-GO、ADNI 2和ADNI 3）。一些受试者从先前阶段转入继续监测，而每个阶段增加新的受试者以进一步研究AD的演变。
#### Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker data 
A𝛽-42, CSF t-tau, and phosphorylated-tau181p, which are biomarkers of amyloid, neuronal injury, and neurofibrillary, respectively, were measured in the ADNI baseline. Full details of the collection are described in a previous study. As shown in, CSF tau/A𝛽42 ratio shows higher sensitivity and specificity in identifying the risk of AD than either just using tau or A𝛽42. To that end, we adopted the CSF tau/A𝛽42 ratio as the AD pathology hallmark in the following analysis, where higher CSF tau/A𝛽42 indicates the higher risk of developing AD. 在ADNI基线测量A 42、CSF t-tau和磷酸化tau 181 p，它们分别是淀粉样蛋白、神经元损伤和神经原纤维的生物标志物。采集的完整详细信息见既往研究。如所示，CSF tau/A 42比值在识别AD风险方面显示出比仅使用tau或A 42更高的敏感性和特异性。为此，我们在以下分析中采用CSF tau/A 42比率作为AD病理学标志，其中较高的CSF tau/A 42指示发展为AD的较高风险。
#### Education and occupation 
The years of education and occupations were recorded in the ADNI database in recruiting subjects. We classified education and occupation using the same criteria in Lo’s study. *Years of education was divided into three categories: high (years of education >17 years), intermediate (years of education 15–17 years), and low (years ofeducation <15 years)*. For the occupation that the ADNI subject performed during most of his/her adult life or with the longest time of service, it was classified into three levels according to the National Statistics Socio-economic classification: 1) high level (professional or managerial), 2) intermediate level (skilled), and 3) low level (partly skilled or unskilled). 在招募受试者时，将受教育年限和职业记录在ADNI数据库中。我们使用Lo研究中的相同标准对教育和职业进行分类。受教育年限分为三类：高（教育年限〉17年）、中（教育年限15-17年）和低（教育年限〈15年）。对于ADNI受试者在其成年生活的大部分时间内从事的职业或服务时间最长的职业，根据国家统计局的社会经济分类将其分为三个级别：1）高级（专业或管理），2）中级（熟练），和3）低级（部分熟练或不熟练）。
#### Genotyping data and quality control 
The genetic data of four phases: ADNI-1, ADNIGO/2, ADNI-GO/2nd, and ADNI-WGS have been used in our study. The ADNI-1, ADNI-GO/2, ADNIGO/2nd, and ADNI-WGS contain 757, 432, 361, and 812 subjects with genotyping data, respectively. The ADNI-WGS phase consists of 261 subjects from ADNI-1, 427 subjects from ADNI-GO/2, and 124 new subjects. For 757 subjects in ADNI-1, genotyping was performed by the Human610-Quad BeadChip (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) included 620,901 SNP and CNV markers. For 432 subjects in ADNI GO/2, genotyping of 730,525 SNPs and CNVs were performed by Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip.  For 361 subjects in ADNI GO/2nd, genotyping of 716,503SNPsandCNVswere performedby Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip. For 812 subjects in ADNI WGS, genotyping of 3.7 million SNPs were performed by Illumina Omni 2.5M (WGS Platform). 四个阶段的遗传数据：我们的研究中使用了ADNI-1、ADNIGO/2、ADNI-GO/2nd和ADNI-WGS。ADNI-1、ADNI-GO/2、ADNIGO/2nd和ADNI-WGS分别包含757、432、361和812例具有基因分型数据的受试者。ADNI-WGS期包括ADNI-1的261例受试者、ADNI-GO/2的427例受试者和124例新受试者。对于ADNI-1中的757名受试者，通过Human610-Quad BeadChip（Illumina，Inc.，圣地亚哥，加利福尼亚州）包括620，901个SNP和CNV标记。对于ADNI GO/2中的432例受试者，使用Illumina HumanOmniExpress微珠芯片对730，525个SNP和CNVs进行基因分型。在ADNI GO/2组的361名受试者中，使用Illumina人类OmniExpress微珠芯片对716，503个SNP和CNVs进行基因分型。对于ADNI WGS中的812例受试者，通过Illumina Omni 2.5M（WGS平台）对370万个SNP进行基因分型。
We performed quality control on the genotype data of each phase of ADNI by plink 1.90, similar to the procedure described in [57]. We only consider autosomal SNPs and SNPs are excluded from further analysis if they do not meet any criteria listed: 1) call rate per SNPs >95%; 2) minor allele frequency ≥1%; 3) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test of  p≥10−6. Subjects are excluded from further analysis if they do not meet any criteria listed: 1) call rate  per participant ≥95%; 2) genotypic sex check with reported sex; 3) genotypic check for cryptic relatedness (3 related pairs were identified with PI HAT >0.2, one ofthemwas randomly excluded). The same quality control procedures were repeated for ADNI GO/2 and ADNI WGS.   
我们使用plink 1.90对ADNI各期的基因型数据进行了质量控制，程序与[57]所述类似。我们仅考虑常染色体SNP，如果SNP不符合以下列出的任何标准，则将其从进一步分析中排除：1）单核苷酸多态性检出率〉95%;2）次要等位基因频率≥ 1%;（3）p ≥ 10 − 6的哈迪-温伯格平衡检验。如果受试者不符合以下列出的任何标准，则将其从进一步分析中排除：1）每名受试者呼叫率≥ 95%;2）报告性别的基因型性别检查;3）隐性相关性的基因型检测（3对相关对的PI HAT〉0.2，其中1对被随机排除）。对ADNI GO/2和ADNI WGS重复相同的质量控制程序。
After the quality control procedure, 541,007 SNPs in 751 participants in ADNI-1 were left for imputation. For ADNI-GO2 643,511 SNPs and 429 participants were left for imputation. For ADNIGO2nd 637,069 variants and 359 subjects were left for imputation. ADNI-WGS left 1527166 SNPs, 808 subjects for imputation. Then we used the Michigan Imputation Server to impute each phase of the ADNI genotype data. ADNI-1 data was lifted from hg18 to hg19, as it was recorded on the human reference genome, GRCh37. While the other ADNI data are originally in GRCh38. Here, we follow the workflow in to perform the imputation: 1) 1000 Genome Phase 3 v5 (hg19) as the reference panel; 2) Phased by Eagle; 3) used mixed population as reference panel; 4) Rsq filter was 0.3. After the imputation, we merged all four ADNI phases data together and filtered the SNPs byMAF>0.05 and performed an identity check for cryptic related pairs (7 related pairs were identified with PI HAT>0.2, one ofeach pairwas randomly excluded). For the subjects genotyped in multiple phases,wekeep the most recent genotyping record for further analysis. After all the former quality control procedures, 9,432,719 SNPs in 1,661 subjects were kept.  
在质量控制程序之后，751名ADNI-1参与者的541，007个SNP被用于插补。对于ADNI-GO2，643，511个SNP和429例受试者留待插补。对于ADNIGO2nd，637，069个变体和359例受试者留待插补。ADNI-WGS留下了1527166个SNP，808例受试者用于插补。然后我们使用密歇根插补服务器插补ADNI基因型数据的每个阶段。ADNI-1数据从hg18提升到hg19，因为它记录在人类参考基因组GRCh37上。而其他ADNI数据最初位于GRCh38中。在此，我们按照中的工作流执行插补：1）1000基因组3期v5（hg19）作为参照组;2）由Eagle分阶段;3）以混合人群为参照组;4）Rsq滤波器为0.3。插补后，我们将所有四个ADNI阶段的数据合并在一起，通过MAF〉0.05过滤SNP，并对潜在相关对进行同一性检查（7个相关对被确定为PI HAT〉0.2，每对中的一个被随机排除）。对于多期基因分型的受试者，我们保留最新的基因分型记录以供进一步分析。经过上述所有质量控制程序后，保留了1，661名受试者的9，432，719个SNP。
#### Calculation of PRS 
We are interested in testing the association between PRS of AD and the AD pathophysiology. First, we filtered the SNP in the GWAS results in CTG lab (https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/summary statistics)  by MAF greater than 0.01. Then, the SNPs were LD pruned with r2 = 0.1 in a 1000 kb window, 324,982 SNPs were left after the pruning. And we utilized Plink 1.9 to calculate the weighted PRS of AD using SNPs with AD association of p<10–4. 
我们感兴趣的是检测阿尔茨海默病的PRS和AD病理生理学之间的联系。首先，我们通过大于0.01的MAF过滤CTG实验室（https：//www.example.com统计）中GWAS结果中的SNP。ctg.cncr.nl/software/summary statistics)  by MAF greater than 0.01.然后，在1000kb的窗口中以r2 = 0.1对SNP进行LD修剪，修剪后剩下324，982个SNP。我们利用Plink 1.9软件计算AD相关性p〈10 - 4的SNP的加权PRS。
#### Statistical methods 
In the following, we first seek for the operational definition ofthe cognitive reserve by applying a logistic regression model on the baseline data. Second, we examine the prognostic value of the cognitive reserve proxy by applying the Cox proportional hazards model on the longitudinal data. 
在下文中，我们首先通过对基线数据应用逻辑回归模型来寻求认知储备的操作定义。其次，我们通过对纵向数据应用考克斯比例风险模型来检验认知储备代理的预测价值。
#### Logistic regression model for the computational proxy ofcognitive reserve 
We assume that the pathophysiology of AD is defined by the AD-specific biological changes (i.e., the increasing CSF tau/A␤42 ratio), which underlines the clinic manifestations. However, the progression of AD is also moderated by socioeconomic statuses, such as education and occupation. In this regard, we conceptualize the mechanism of cognitive resilience as a joint product of pathology risk indicators and socioeconomic factors, where the resistant level can be captured by modeling the relationship between pathological burden and the clinical manifestation of cognitive decline. Each subject has the diagnostic label where y = 1 indicates being diagnosed as AD and otherwise y = 0. The response of our model is the probability of being diagnosed as AD with logit link function, i.e., log it(P(y = 1) = log  p(y=1) 1−p(y=1)  , which is modeled as a linear function ofage, gender, education, occupation, tau/A␤42 ratio, andADPRS. In order to measure the counteract of cognitive reserve, we also included the interactions between AD pathology and educational levels in the model. The logistic model was represented as: 
我们假设AD的病理生理学是由AD特异性生物学变化（即，CSF tau/A β 42比率增加），这突出了临床表现。然而，AD的进展也受到社会经济地位的调节，如教育和职业。在这方面，我们将认知弹性机制概念化为病理学风险指标和社会经济因素的联合产物，其中耐药水平可以通过建模病理学负担和认知下降临床表现之间的关系来捕获。每个受试者具有诊断标签，其中y = 1表示被诊断为AD，否则y = 0。我们模型的响应是被诊断为AD的概率与logit连接函数，即，log it（P（y = 1）= log p（y=1）1−p（y =1），模型为年龄、性别、教育程度、职业、tau/A 42比值和ADPRS的线性函数。为了测量认知储备的反作用，我们还将AD病理和教育水平之间的交互作用纳入模型。逻辑模型表示为：
![[Pasted image 20230227225237.png]]
where xAge,i is age (in years), xGender,i is gender (male: 1; female: 0), xPA,i is pathological burden measured by CSF tau/A␤42 ratio, and xPRS,i is AD  polygenetic risk score for the ith subject. Educational levels and occupational levels were categorized into three levels, and we used dummy coding for all the categorical variables. Female, low educational level, and low occupational level were set as the reference group, respectively. xHigh Edu,i equals 1 if the ith subject has a high educational level and equals 0 otherwise. xMid Edu,i equals 1 if the subject i has the medium educational level, and equals 0 otherwise. So are xMid Occ,i and xHigh Occ,i. The odds ratio (OR) quantifies the expected change in the odds of being diagnosed as AD, for a one-unit increase in the predictor. The area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was calculated to access the logistic model’s performance. Nagelkerke pseudo R-Squared was used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of logistic models. Since educational levels are correlated with occupational levels (please see the correlation analysis in Fig. 2), we additionally conducted a sensitivity analysis by excluding occupational levels from the logistic model. 
其中xAge，i是年龄（岁），xGender，i是性别（男性：1;女性：0），xPA，i是通过CSF tau/A 42比值测量的病理负荷，xPRS，i是第i例受试者的AD多基因风险评分。教育水平和职业水平被分为三个水平，我们使用虚拟编码的所有分类变量。分别以女性、低文化程度、低职业水平为参照组。xHigh Edu，如果第i个科目具有高教育水平，则i等于1，否则等于0。xMid Edu，如果主体i具有中等教育水平，则i等于1，否则等于0。xMid Occ，i和xHigh Occ，i也是如此。比值比（OR）量化了预测因子每增加一个单位，被诊断为AD的比值的预期变化。计算受试者工作特征（ROC）的曲线下面积（AUC），以评估logistic模型的性能。Nagelkerke伪R平方用于评价logistic模型的拟合优度。由于教育水平与职业水平相关（请参见图2中的相关性分析），我们通过从逻辑模型中排除职业水平额外进行了敏感性分析。

#### Cox model for investigating the influence of cognitive reserve 
The Cox proportional hazards model is used to investigate possible factors that affect the progression from MCI to AD longitudinally for subjects with a baseline diagnosis of MCI. Specifically, the time (in months) is defined as the time between baseline visit and the first visit date of being diagnosed as AD for participants as known as MCI-converter. For participants whose progression remains at MCI stage (as known as non-converter), the time is defined from the baseline visit date to the last visit date. We use the same predictors as those in the logistic model.  The Cox model is represented as: 
Cox比例风险模型用于研究基线诊断为MCI的受试者从MCI纵向进展为AD的可能影响因素。具体而言，时间（月）定义为基线访视与被诊断为AD的受试者（称为MCI转换者）的首次访视日期之间的时间。对于进展仍处于MCI阶段的受试者（称为未转换），时间定义为从基线访视日期至末次访视日期。我们使用与logistic模型相同的预测因子。Cox模型表示为：
![[Pasted image 20230227225333.png]]
where T denotes for time, h(t) is the hazard function (instantaneous rate for progression to AD to occur for subjects that have survived up to time t), hi(t|xi)was the hazard function at time t for the ith participant, h0(t) was the unspecified baseline hazard function when all predictors are 0, and others are the same as the logistic model. The hazard ratio (HR) quantifies the relative hazard of progression from MCI to AD with a one-unit increase in the predictor. HR > 1 indicates that the progression hazard increased with a larger value of the predictor. Similarly, we additionally conducted a sensitivity analysis by excluding occupational levels from the Cox model. 
其中T表示时间，h（t）是风险函数（对于存活至时间t的受试者，发生进展至AD的瞬时速率），hi（t|xi）为第i名受试者在时间t的风险函数，h0（t）为所有预测因子均为0时未指定的基线风险函数，其他与logistic模型相同。风险比（HR）量化了预测因子每增加一个单位，从MCI进展为AD的相对风险。HR〉1表明进展风险随预测因子值的增大而增大。同样，我们还通过从考克斯模型中排除职业水平进行了敏感性分析。

## 2. Associations between lesions and domain-specific cognitive decline in poststroke dementia (2018). Binary outcome. PSD
*Objective*: To investigate whether the effect of prestroke and *stroke-related lesions on incident poststroke dementia* (**PSD**) is *mediated by a unique pattern of domain-specific cognitive impairment*, and the relative strength of these anatomical–cognitive associations in predicting incident PSD. 
*Methods*: In this incident case-control study (n = 150), we defined incident cases as acute stroke patients who developed PSD and controls as acute stroke patients who remained free from dementia at a 6 month follow-up, matched on age, prestroke cognitive status, and number ofstroke-related lesions. MRI was performed at initial clinical presentation; neuropsychological assessments and clinical diagnosis of PSD was performed 6 months poststroke. Moderated mediation analysis evaluated the interactions among PSD, anatomical lesions, cognitive domains, and individual demographic and medical characteristics. 
*Results*: Compared to stroke-related lesions, prestroke lesions were associated with the widest range of cognitive domain impairments and had stronger clinical utility in predicting incident PSD. Specifically, *global cortical atrophy* (GCA) and *deep white matter hyperintensities* (WMH) were indirectly associated with PSD by disrupting executive functions, memory, and language. Acute infarcts were indirectly associated with PSD by disrupting executive functions and language. The strongest mediator was executive dysfunction, increasing risk ofPSD in patients with deep WMH, GCA, and large infarcts by more than 9 times, with sex and *educational attainment moderating the magnitude of association*. Periventricular WMH were directly associated with incident PSD but not mediated by deficits in cognitive domains. 
*Conclusion*: We provide an anatomical–cognitive framework that can be applied to stratify patients at highest risk of PSD and to guide personalized interventions. 

This study employed an *incident case-control design*. Incident cases were defined as *acute stroke patients* without prior dementia who *developed PSD at a 6-month follow-up*, and controls were defined as acute stroke patients without  dementia who *remained free from dementia at the 6-month follow-up*. Cases and controls were recruited from a public tertiary stroke clinic (National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore) following discharge from inpatient care for acute mild ischemic stroke between 2008 and 2012. PSD was diagnosed by neurologists using the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke–Association Internationale pour la Recherche en l’Enseignement en Neurosciences criteria following an evaluation ofmedical history, prestroke cognitive functioning using the Informant Questionnaire of Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), cognition-related functional impairment using a structured questionnaire, and depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (supplementary material, links.lww.com/WNL/A543; figure e-1, links.lww.com/WNL/A541; and table e-1, links.lww. com/WNL/A542). Inclusion criteria included patients with an MRI-confirmed acute infarct. *Exclusion criteria* included (1) prestroke dementia, as determined by an IQCODE19 score of <3.6, (2) functional disability, as determined by modified Rankin Scale score (mRS)20 of >2 at the time of discharge, (3) a history of or current major depression, as determined by clinical reports or PHQ-921 of >9, (4) comorbid neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson disease), (5) a history of or current alcohol/drug abuse, and (6) presentation to outpatient clinic outside of 6 months. Upon admission to the neurology ward, all patients suspected of an acute stroke underwent a MRI scan and were tested on the mRS. Neuropsychological assessment and diagnosis of PSD was conducted at the 6-month follow-up according to guidelines22 in order to allow time for resolution ofanypossible poststroke delirium that may affect cognitive test performance. 

Demographic and medical information was collected from admission records. Participants’ cardiovascular risk profile was determined using the Framingham office-based cardiovascular disease risk prediction model, which took into account age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, smoking, and diabetes.23 Depressive symptoms were indexed using the PHQ-9.21 

Domain-specific cognitive assessments included *executive functions*, measured with the **Frontal Assessment Battery**; *delayed memory*, measured with the **Wechsler Ten Word Delayed Recall task**; *attention*, measured with the **Wechsler Digit Span Forward task**; and *language*, measured with the **Wechsler animal fluency task**.

Cases and controls were matched on age to control for age effects on cognitive decline. The primary analysis involved a *mediation analysis*, which quantified whether anatomical *lesions* indirectly affected *PSD* by impairing specific *cognitive domains*. A subsequent *moderation analysis* quantified whether significant mediation effects were enhanced or attenuated by *individual demographics and medical conditions*. 

*Differences* in demographics, cognitive function, and MRI markers between patients who developed *PSD* and those who remained *cognitively normal* were determined using a MannWhitneyUtest for all continuous and ordinal variables and χ2 test for all categorical variables. Mediation An individual mediation model was fitted for each lesion type and cognitive domain. That is, each model included one cerebral lesion as the predictor, one cognitive domain as the mediator, and PSD as the outcome. Each model controlled for sex, educational attainment, total cardiovascular risk profile, residual age effects left after matching, and other lesion types. The mediation model was significant if the relationship between the anatomical lesion and PSD (path c in figure 1) was reduced when controlling for the mediator. Full mediation was implied ifthe direct relationship between lesions and PSD was no longer significant after including the mediator, while partial mediation was implied ifthe direct relationship was still significant after including the mediator. For significant mediation findings involving acute infarcts, a post hoc mediation analysis identified the specific cortical or noncortical regions of significance. 
An individual moderation model was fitted for *each significant mediation finding* and each individual characteristic. Moderation involved *multiplying the anatomical lesion (X in figure 1) with individual characteristics* (W in figure 1), namely, age, sex, ==years of educational attainment==, cardiovascular risk score, and depression. If XW was significantly related to cognitive domains (M in figure 2; XW→ M), and indirectly related to the PSD (Y in figure 2) (XW → M→ Y), we noted that moderated mediation had occurred. 
The statistical analyses for mediation and moderation models were carried out using the SPSS macro PROCESS, which applies *logistic regression models for mediation effects with ==binary outcomes==*. A nonparametric approach for effect size estimation was applied using bias-corrected (BC) bootstrap estimation with 1,000 resamples. A *BC 95% bootstrapped confidence interval* (CI) that did not contain zero indicated a significant effect. BC bootstrap methods derive robust parameter estimates based on maximized statistical power and limited type 1 error; however, given the exploratory nature of the study, we applied a more stringent criterion *for controlling type 1 error*. This involved applying the *Sobel test*, which has been recommended for multiple comparisons involving mediation due to its more conservative p value estimations. 

High *educational* attainment *attenuated* the association between *PSD* and both *large cortical infracts* (*b = −0.03, SE = 0.02, p = 0.03*, 95% CI = −0.07 to −0.01) and *deep WMH* (b = −0.03, SE = 0.02, p = 0.04, 95% CI = −0.06 to −0.01), as mediated by executive functions. Female sex strengthened the association between global cortical atrophy and PSD as mediated by executive functions (b = 0.05, SE = 0.03, p = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.01–0.13), and attenuated the association between small temporal infarcts and PSD as mediated by language (b = −0.04, SE = 0.03, p = 0.03, 95% CI = −0.88 to −0.03). No moderation effects were observed for age, cardiovascular risk, or subclinical depressive symptoms (p > 0.05). 
To interpret the mediation findings within a clinically useful context, we derived odds ratios (ORs) using logistic regression with dichotomized predictor variables. The predictor variables, namely anatomical lesions and cognitive domains, were dichotomized using validated cutoffs. These dichotomized variables were multiplied and regressed onto PSD. In this way, the ORs represented the odds of PSD given clinically significant impairment in the anatomical location and cognitive domain. The effect size for the OR was interpreted using Sullivan and Feinn’s guidelines where a small OR = 1.5, moderate OR = 3, and large OR = 4.

## 1. Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
Neuroimaging measures and chemical biomarkers may be important indices of clinical progression in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and need to be evaluated longitudinally.  To characterize cross-sectionally and longitudinally clinical measures in normal controls, subjects with MCI, and subjects with mild Alzheimer disease (AD) to enable the assessment of the utility of neuroimaging and chemical biomarker measures.  A **total of 819 subjects (229 cognitively normal, 398 with MCI, and 192 with AD)** were enrolled at baseline and followed for 12 months using standard cognitive and functional measures typical of clinical trials.  The subjects with MCI were more memory impaired than the cognitively normal subjects but not as impaired as the subjects with AD. Nonmemory cognitive measures were only minimally impaired in the subjects with MCI. The subjects with MCI progressed to dementia in 12 months at a rate of 16.5% per year. Approximately 50% of the subjects with MCI were on antidementia therapies. There was minimal movement on the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale for the normal control subjects, slight movement for the subjects with MCI of 1.1, and a modest change for the subjects with AD of 4.3. Baseline CSF measures of A␤-42 separated the 3 groups as expected and successfully predicted the 12-month change in cognitive measures.  The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative has successfully recruited cohorts of cognitively normal subjects, subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjects with Alzheimer disease with anticipated baseline characteristics. The 12-month progression rate of MCI was as predicted, and the CSF measures heralded progression of clinical measures over 12 months. 神经影像学指标和化学生物标志物可能是正常衰老和轻度认知障碍（MCI）临床进展的重要指标，需要进行纵向评估。描述正常对照、MCI受试者和轻度阿尔茨海默病（AD）受试者的横断面和纵向临床指标，以评估神经影像学和化学生物标志物指标的效用。共有819例受试者（229例认知正常，398例MCI，192例AD）在基线时入组，并使用临床试验中典型的标准认知和功能测量方法随访12个月。MCI受试者的记忆受损程度高于认知正常受试者，但不如AD受试者。MCI受试者的非记忆性认知指标仅受到轻微损害。MCI受试者在12个月内以每年16.5%的速度进展为痴呆。大约50%的MCI受试者正在接受抗痴呆治疗。在阿尔茨海默病评估量表-认知子量表中，正常对照受试者的运动最小，MCI为1.1的受试者轻微运动，AD为4.3的受试者中度变化。A -42的基线CSF测量值按预期将3组分开，并成功预测了认知测量值的12个月变化。阿尔茨海默病神经成像倡议已成功招募了认知正常受试者、轻度认知障碍（MCI）受试者和具有预期基线特征的阿尔茨海默病受试者队列。MCI的12个月进展率与预测一致，CSF指标预示着12个月内临床指标的进展。

Most investigators believe that Alzheimer disease (AD) is a slowly evolving process that likely begins years to decades before the clinical symptoms are manifest. There is a strong interest in identifying individuals at an earlier stage in the AD neuropathologic spectrum before the full clinical criteria for AD are met. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents an attempt to characterize subjects at an early clinical phase and has been a target for clinical trials. Neuroimaging and chemical biomark ers may allow detection of the neurodegenerative process at an earlier point in the spectrum and increase our ability to detect treatment effects in clinical trials.  大多数研究者认为阿尔茨海默病（AD）是一个缓慢发展的过程，可能在临床症状出现前数年至数十年开始。在满足AD的全部临床标准之前，在AD神经病理谱的早期阶段识别个体具有强烈的兴趣。轻度认知障碍（MCI）代表了在早期临床阶段表征受试者的尝试，并且已成为临床试验的目标。神经影像学和化学生物标志物可能允许在谱中的较早点检测神经退行性过程，并提高我们在临床试验中检测治疗效果的能力。The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a consortium of universities and medical centers in the United States and Canada established to develop standardized imaging techniques and biomarker procedures in normal subjects, subjects with MCI, and subjects with mild AD. The major goals ofADNI are to develop improved methods that will lead to uniform standards for acquiring longitudinal, multisite MRI and PET data on patients with AD, patients with MCI, and elderly controls, to develop an accessible data repository that describes longitudinal changes in brain structure and metabolism while acquiring in parallel clinical, cognitive, and biochemical data, to develop methods that will maximize power to  determine treatment effects in clinical trials, and to test a series of hypotheses based on clinical and biomarker data.  阿尔茨海默病神经成像倡议（ADNI）是美国和加拿大大学和医学中心的联合体，旨在开发正常受试者、MCI受试者和轻度AD受试者的标准化成像技术和生物标志物程序。**ADNI的主要目标是开发改进的方法，为AD患者、MCI患者和老年对照患者的纵向、多部位MRI和PET数据采集提供统一的标准，开发可访问的数据库，描述脑结构和代谢的纵向变化，同时并行采集临床、认知和生化数据**。开发将最大化把握度的方法，以确定临床试验中的治疗效果，并基于临床和生物标志物数据检验一系列假设。

As noted in table 1, the normal subjects and subjects with MCI were evaluated approximately every 6 months for up to 3 years with telephone visits being performed at months 18 and 30. The subjects with AD were followed every 6 months for 24 months with a telephone contact at month 18. The primary outcome measures were the rate ofprogress from MCI to AD as well as a variety ofimaging and chemical biomarkers. Rates of change were calculated for the imaging measures, each biomarker, and glucose metabolism for specified regions ofinterest on FDG PET scanning. 所有受试者均接受1.5特斯拉信号强度的MRI扫描;25%的受试者还接受了3特斯拉MRI扫描，50%接受了FDG PET扫描，每个研究中心至少20%的受试者还接受了腰椎穿刺。如表1所示，大约每6个月对正常受试者和MCI受试者进行一次评估，持续3年，在第18个月和第30个月进行电话访视。AD受试者每6个月随访一次，持续24个月，并在第18个月进行电话联系。主要结果指标是MCI进展为AD的速度以及各种影像学和化学生物标志物。计算FDG PET扫描特定感兴趣区域的影像学指标、每种生物标志物和葡萄糖代谢的变化率。

### Data analysis. 
Baseline characteristics of the participants were summarized by diagnostic group (mean and SD for quantitative measures, proportion or percent for categorical variables). Group characteristics at baseline were compared by nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis) for quantitative measures, using a Hochberg multiple comparison procedure to compare means, and using 𝝌2 or exact tests to compare proportions. Change over time was summarized 3 different ways: conversion proportion, mean or percent difference in quantitative measure between baseline and 12-month follow-up, and rate ofchange per year estimated from mixed effects regression models for quantitative measures using all available follow-up data. Annual rates of conversion were estimated using a hybrid estimate of the distribution function as proposed by Wellner and Zahn for interval censored data. Differences in rate of change over time across groups were assessed in the mixed effects regression models by adding as covariates both a main effect term to estimate baseline differences and an interaction with time to test differences in rates of change. Similarly, the potential of biomarker or imaging marker level at baseline to account for within-group heterogeneity in rates of change was assessed by adding both a main effect term and an interaction term with time to the mixed effects regression models. All hypothesis tests were 2-sided at level 0.05, and models were validated both graphically and analytically. SAS/STAT® software and R were used for statistical analysis.  数据分析。按诊断组总结受试者的基线特征（定量指标的平均值和SD，分类变量的比例或百分比）。通过定量测量的非参数检验（Kruskal-Wallis）比较基线时的组特征，使用Hochberg多重比较程序比较平均值，使用2或精确检验比较比例。以3种不同方式总结随时间的变化：转换比例、基线和12个月随访之间定量指标的平均值或百分比差异，以及使用所有可用随访数据根据定量指标的混合效应回归模型估计的每年变化率。使用Wellner和Zahn针对区间删失数据提出的分布函数混合估计值估计年转换率。在混合效应回归模型中，通过添加主效应项（估计基线差异）和与时间的相互作用（检验变化率差异）作为协变量，评估组间变化率随时间的差异。同样，通过在混合效应回归模型中添加主效应项和与时间的相互作用项，评估基线时生物标志物或影像学标志物水平解释组内变化率异质性的可能性。所有假设检验均为双侧，水平为0.05，并通过图形和分析验证模型。采用SAS/STAT®软件和R进行统计分析。

### RESULTS 
Baseline characteristics. A total of 819 subjects were recruited and received a baseline evaluation as part of the ADNI study. There were 229 normal control subjects, 398 subjects with MCI, and 192 subjects with mild AD enrolled. As shown in table 2, the mean age of the 3 groups was equivalent at approximately 75 years. There were an approximately equal number ofmen and women in the normal control and AD groups, but there were more men than women in the MCI group (64.6% men vs 35.4% women). The estimated premorbid verbal IQ ofthese subjects was quite high, at almost 120 for the normal control subjects, 116 for the subjects with MCI, and 114 for the subjects with AD. Most of the subjects in the study were white, and this was approximately equivalent across the groups. 

The mean scores for the screening measures (MMSE, Paragraph Recall, CDR, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Hachinski Scale) and the Functional Assessment Questionnaire are shown in table 3. In all cases except the Hachinski Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale, the mean scores for the 3 groups differed significantly at p ⬍ 0.001, with normal controls performing best, subjects with AD worst, and subjects with MCI in the middle. Overall, subjects with MCI had a mean total Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) score of 11.5, while the normal control subjects had a score of6.2 and the subjects with mild AD had a score of 18.7 (p ⬍ 0.001, table 3). The 3 groups also differed significantly in each of the subscales, with the MCI mean scores worse than those for nor mal participants but not as poor as those for participants with AD (table 3). These scores indicated, however, that the subjects with MCI gained most of their error points on memory items. The neuropsychological battery indicated that, in general, subjects with MCI were more impaired than controls on the memory items and were only mildly impaired in nonmemory domains (table 3). The subjects with AD were impaired in virtually all of the cognitive areas tested. The next greatest area of impairment for the subjects with MCI resulted from the executive function domain.  Concomitant medications. Appropriate treatments for dementia were allowed in the subjects with MCI and subjects with AD. The following percentages of  subjects were on therapy at baseline: cholinesterase inhibitors—normal controls 0%, subjects with MCI 43.7%, subjects with AD 84.9%; memantine—normal controls 0%, subjects with MCI 10.8%, subjects with AD 47.4%; combined cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine—normal controls 0%, subjects with MCI 8.8%, subjects with AD 40.6%. 筛选指标（MMSE、段落回忆、CDR、老年抑郁量表和Hachinski量表）和功能评估问卷的平均评分见表3。在所有情况下，除了Hachinski量表和老年抑郁量表，3组的平均评分差异显著，p 0.001，正常对照组表现最好，AD受试者表现最差，MCI受试者表现居中。总体而言，MCI受试者的平均总阿尔茨海默病评估量表-认知子量表（ADAS-Cog）评分为11.5，而正常对照受试者的评分为6.2，轻度AD受试者的评分为18.7（p 0.001，表3）。3组在每个分量表中也有显著差异，MCI平均评分比正常参与者差，但不像AD参与者差（表3）。然而，这些分数表明，MCI受试者在记忆项目上获得了大部分错误分数。神经心理学成套测验表明，一般来说，MCI受试者在记忆项目上比对照组受损更严重，在非记忆领域仅轻度受损（表3）。AD受试者几乎在所有测试的认知领域都受损。MCI受试者的下一个最大损害领域来自执行功能领域。合并用药。允许MCI受试者和AD受试者接受适当的痴呆治疗。基线时接受治疗的受试者百分比如下：胆碱酯酶抑制剂-正常对照组0%，MCI组43.7%，AD组84.9%;正常对照组0%，MCI组10.8%，AD组47.4%;联合胆碱酯酶抑制剂和美金刚胺正常对照组0%，MCI受试者8.8%，AD受试者40.6%。

Twelve-month follow-up measures. The mean differences in performance of the subjects between baseline and 12 months are shown in table 4. In general, the normal group stayed nearly the same, and the AD group worsened significantly compared to the normal controls. The MCI group was more variable; in most cases they worsened more than the normal group but not as much as the AD group, but they looked more like the AD group for change in digit span, category fluency, and trail making, and more like the normal controls for the clock test and global CDR. The CDR sum of the boxes essentially did not change in the normal control group (0.1) and increased by approximately 0.7 points in the subjects with MCI and 1.5 points in the subjects with AD (p ⬍ 0.001). On the memory measures such as the AVLT, there was virtually no change across 12 months in learning in the normal control group with a decreased learning of 1.3 items in the subjects with MCI and 3.7 fewer items learned in the AD group. Delayed recall improved by 5.3% in the normal control group and declined by 4.8% in the subjects with MCI and 7.2% in the subjects with AD.  Table 4 shows the neuropsychological test changes over 12 months. Among the 229 subjects who were recruited in the normal control group, only 3 progressed to MCI over 12 months and none to AD; 17 did not have final diagnosis for 12-month follow-up. Allowing for interval-censored data, the estimated conversion rate was just 1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0%–3.2%). Among the 398 subjects with MCI at baseline, 64 progressed to AD at 12 months for a progression rate of 16.5% (95% CI 11.9%–20.5%). An additional 8 subjects with MCI reverted to a normal classification over that interval, and 41 did not have a follow-up diagnosis. Of the 192 subjects with AD, virtually all ofthem remained in that category, while 2 reverted to MCI status at 12 months. Table 5 shows the baseline cognitive characteristics of the subjects with MCI who progress and do not progress to dementia over the course of the first 12 months. 12个月随访措施。表4显示了基线和12个月之间受试者表现的平均差异。一般来说，正常组几乎保持不变，AD组与正常对照组相比显著恶化。MCI组变异性较大;在大多数情况下，他们比正常组恶化得更多，但不如AD组严重，但他们在数字广度、类别流畅性和线索制作方面的变化更像AD组，而在时钟测试和总体CDR方面更像正常对照组。正常对照组的CDR总和基本上没有变化（0.1），MCI受试者增加了约0.7分，AD受试者增加了1.5分（p 0.001）。在记忆测量如AVLT方面，正常对照组在12个月内学习几乎没有变化，MCI受试者学习减少1.3个项目，AD组学习减少3.7个项目。正常对照组的延迟回忆改善了5.3%，MCI组下降了4.8%，AD组下降了7.2%。表4显示了12个月内神经心理学测试的变化。正常对照组229例中，12个月内仅3例进展为MCI，无1例进展为AD;17例在12个月随访时未获得最终诊断。考虑到区间删失数据，估计转换率仅为1.4%（95%置信区间[CI] 0%-3.2%）。在基线时有MCI的398例受试者中，64例在12个月时进展为AD，进展率为16.5%（95% CI 11.9%-20.5%）。另外8例MCI受试者在此期间恢复至正常分类，41例无随访诊断。在192例AD受试者中，几乎所有的受试者都保持在该类别，而2例在12个月时恢复为MCI状态。表5显示了在最初12个月内进展和未进展为痴呆的MCI受试者的基线认知特征。

**Stratification by CSF A𝛽-42 levels**
CSF A𝛽-42 levels were assessed at baseline and were correlated with clinical diagnoses, performance on the ADAS-Cog, and changes in performance on the ADAS-Cog over 1 year (table 3). Baseline A𝛽-42 levels decreased significantly across the diagnostic categories as follows (mean± SE): normal controls 206 ± 5; MCI 164 ± 4; AD 143 ± 4(p < 0.001). Higher levels ofA𝛽-42 were associated with better performance on the ADAS-Cog in normal subjects (r = -0.21; 95% CI -0.38 to -0.03) and subjects with MCI (r = -0.22; 95% CI -0.035 to -0.08). The correlation with the ADAS-Cog in AD was not significant. Similarly, the annual rate of change on the ADAS-Cog against A𝛽-42 at screening suggested that higher baseline levels of A␤-42 were associated with a smaller change over 12 months in the normal subjects (r = -0.23; 95% CI -0.40 to -0.05) and in MCI (r = -0.29; 95% CI -0.41 to -0.16). The  mixed effects models suggested that higher levels of A𝛽-42 were associated with improved performance on the ADAS-Cog in normal subjects (p = 0.01) and in subjects with MCI (p <0.00). The interaction of A𝛽-42 and time also had a significant effect on ADAS-Cog scores in subjects with MCI (p =0.00), but not in normal subjects. There was no significant baseline A𝛽-42 effect observed over 12 months in the subjects with AD. The CSF changes over 12 months are shown in table 4.

### DISCUSSION 
The recruitment for ADNI was designed to simulate a clinical trial population. As such, the baseline characteristics ofthe subjects indicated that the 3 groups were generally well educated, intelligent, and mostly white, and perform in a fashion similar to subjects recruited for typical clinical trials. The summary ofthe baseline characteristics ofthe subjects indicated that the subjects with MCI were memory impaired compared to the normal controls and their memory performance was slightly better than that of the subjects with mild AD by design. With respect to nonmemory domains, the subjects with MCI were more similar to the normal control subjects than they were to the subjects with AD. As such, the MCI group recruited in this study represents individuals in a transitional state between cognitive changes of normal aging and clinical features and the clinical criteria for probable AD. The subjects recruited for ADNI likely do not represent “typical” subjects in the community. They tend to be more highly educated and the proportion ofAPOE4 carriers was quite high in the MCI and AD groups but is consistent with subjects recruited for clinical trials. The 12-month change data indicated little movement on many of the global scales. As would be expected, the control subjects essentially remained stable or improved slightly. The subjects with MCI also remained relatively stable as a group, and the subjects with mild AD showed a decline on most of these measures. The variability among the subjects increased across the 3 clinical groups from normal to MCI to AD. There was somewhat less variability on the global measures, while some of the individual neuropsychological tests such as the AVLT showed considerable variability among the subjects despite relatively modest mean group changes. The diagnostic conversions over the 12-month period must be viewed with some caution. A 12month change period is not a sufficient amount of time to draw conclusions regarding the likelihood of clinical change. However, there was considerable movement from the MCI group to the AD group over the 12 months at the progression rate of 16% per year as projected. This was in part by design since the criteria used to recruit subjects with MCI required a rather stringent degree of memory impairment to be included in the diagnostic classification group. As such, these subjects were likely further down the clinical spectrum with respect to the underlying AD process such that they would be more likely to progress than subjects with less impairment in the MCI spectrum. The CSF A𝛽-42 data correlated with the diagnostic groups in the expected fashion with levels being lower in the subjects with MCI than in the normal subjects. Correspondingly, the subjects with AD had lower A𝛽-42 levels. In addition, the lower the CSF A𝛽-42 level at baseline, the greater the cognitive change over 12 months in both the normal subjects and subjects with MCI, suggesting that baseline A𝛽 levels might be used to stratify subjects’ likelihood of progressing more rapidly. This might be a useful technique to reduce the numbers of subjects used in clinical trials to detect a clinical effect of therapeutic interventions. ADNI was successful in recruiting a cohort of subjects that was very similar to those seen in MCI and mild AD clinical trials. This subject population serves as an excellent resource for the study of the role of imaging and chemical biomarkers in tracking the AD disease process. The entire ADNI dataset, including demographic, clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and biochemical biomarker data, is available online for analysis by investigators  讨论的招聘ADNI旨在模拟临床试验的人口。因此,受试者的基线特征表明,3组一般受过良好教育,聪明,和大部分是白人,在一个时装表演类似为典型的临床试验受试者招募。基线特征总结表明,受试者与MCI的受试者记忆受损与正常对照组相比,他们的记忆力表现略优于受试者有轻微的广告设计。关于nonmemory域,与MCI的受试者更类似于正常对照组比与广告的主题。在这项研究中,MCI组招募代表个体之间的过渡状态正常老化和认知变化的临床特征和临床标准可能的广告。受试者招募ADNI可能不代表“典型”主题社区。他们往往是更多的受过高等教育的比例ofAPOE4运营商是MCI和广告组很高但符合临床试验受试者招募。12个月改变数据显示在许多全球尺度的小运动。正如人们预期的那样,对照组基本上保持稳定或略有改善。受试者与MCI也保持相对稳定的作为一个群体,和温和的主题广告显示下降在大多数的这些措施。学科之间的差异性增加整个3临床组织从正常到MCI向AD。有较小变化对全球措施,虽然有些个人的神经心理学测试,如AVLT显示受试者尽管相对温和的意思是群差异很大的变化。诊断转换在12个月期间必须被谨慎对待。一个12个月的变化不是一个足够的时间得出结论关于临床变化的可能性。然而,有相当大的运动从MCI组到广告组在12个月的预计以每年16%的速度发展。这是部分设计标准与MCI招募受试者使用要求相当严格程度的记忆障碍被包括在诊断分类组。这样,这些受试者可能进一步的临床表现对底层广告过程中,这样他们会更容易进步比MCI谱对象用更少的缺陷。CSF A𝛽-42数据与诊断相关组以预期的方式与MCI受试者水平是低于正常人。相应地,广告较低的受试者␤-42年的水平。此外,CSF␤-42在基线水平越低,更大的认知变化超过12个月的正常与MCI主题和主题,表明基线␤水平可能用于分层受试者更快进步的可能性。这可能是一个有用的技术来降低受试者在临床试验中使用的数字检测治疗干预的临床效果。ADNI成功招募一群非常相似的主题在MCI和轻度AD的临床试验。这一主题研究人口作为一个优秀的资源的作用成像和化学生物标志物跟踪广告的疾病过程。整个ADNI数据集,包括人口统计学、临床神经心理学、神经影像、生化生物标记数据,由调查人员网上进行分析

## 1. Association of Cerebral Amyloid-β Aggregation With Cognitive Functioning in Persons Without Dementia (2017) Only ns p
### Intro
Cerebral amyloid-β aggregation is an early event in Alzheimer disease (AD). Understanding the association between amyloid aggregation and cognitive manifestation in persons without dementia is important for a better understanding of the course of AD and for the design of prevention trials. To investigate *whether amyloid-β aggregation is associated with cognitive functioning in persons without dementia*. This cross-sectional study included 2908 participants with normal cognition and 4133 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from 53 studies in the multicenter Amyloid Biomarker Study. Normal cognition was defined as having no cognitive concerns for which medical help was sought and scores within the normal range on cognitive tests. Mild cognitive impairment was diagnosed according to published criteria. Study inclusion began in 2013 and is ongoing. Data analysis was performed in January 2017. 这项横断面研究包括2908名认知正常的参与者和4133名轻度认知障碍（MCI）的参与者，这些参与者来自多中心淀粉样蛋白生物标志物研究的53项研究。正常认知被定义为没有寻求医疗帮助的认知问题，并且认知测试得分在正常范围内。根据已发表的标准诊断轻度认知障碍。研究纳入开始于2013年，目前正在进行中。数据分析于2017年1月进行。*Global cognitive performance* as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (*MMSE*) and *episodic memory* performance as assessed by a *verbal word learning test*. Amyloid aggregation was measured with *positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers* and dichotomized as negative (normal) or positive (abnormal) according to study-specific cutoffs. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between amyloid aggregation and low cognitive scores (MMSE score <=27 or memory z score <= −1.28) and to assess whether this association was moderated by age, sex, educational level, or apolipoprotein E genotype. 

Among *2908* persons with *normal* cognition (mean (SD] age, 67.4 (12.8] years), amyloid positivity was *associated with low memory* scores after age 70 years (mean difference in amyloid positive vs negative, 4%(95% CI, 0%-7%] at 72 years and 21% (95% CI, 10%-33%] at 90 years) but was *not* associated with *low MMSE scores* (mean difference, 3%(95% CI, −1% to 6%], P = .16). Among *4133* patients with *MCI* (mean (SD] age, 70.2 (8.5] years), amyloid positivity was associated with low memory (mean difference, 16%(95% CI, 12%-20%], P < .001) and *low MMSE* (mean difference, 14%(95% CI, 12%-17%], P < .001) scores, and *this association decreased with age*. Low cognitive scores had limited utility for screening of amyloid positivity in persons with normal cognition and those with MCI. In persons with normal cognition, the age-related increase in low memory score paralleled the age-related increase in amyloid positivity with an intervening period of 10 to 15 years. Although low memory scores are an early marker of amyloid positivity, their value as a screening measure for early AD among persons without dementia is limited.

cerebral amyloid-β aggregation is an early pathologic event in Alzheimer disease (AD), starting 2 to 3 decades beforedementia onset.1,2 Approximately 25%of cognitivelynormalelderlyindividualsand50%ofpatientswith mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have biomarker evidence of amyloid pathology.1,3 These persons are at increased risk for developing AD-type dementia,1 but the extent to which amyloid-β aggregation is associatedwithcognition inpersonswithout dementia is unclear. Understanding the association between amyloid pathology and cognitive functioning is important for a better understanding of the course ofAD and for the design ofAD-prevention trials. Longitudinalcohortstudies4-6haverevealedanassociation betweenthepresenceofamyloidpathologyandlong-termcognitive decline.Toassess the role ofcognitive screeningas a tool to enrich AD clinical trials, the cross-sectional association also needstobeestablished.However, findingsfromcross-sectional studies in cognitively normal individuals4,7,8 andpatientswith MCI7,9,10havebeeninconsistent. This variabilitymaybecaused by differences among studies in demographic and genetic factors, disease stage and reserve capacity, and methodologic approaches.Effectsaremainlyobservedintheepisodicmemory andglobal cognitiondomainsand tend tobesmall,11 indicating that large samples are needed to investigate the amyloidcognition association. 脑淀粉样β蛋白聚集是阿尔茨海默病早期病理事件1，2大约25%的认知功能正常的老年人和50%的轻度认知功能障碍患者（MCI）具有淀粉样蛋白病理学的生物标志物证据。1，3这些人发生AD型痴呆的风险增加，1，但淀粉样蛋白β聚集与非痴呆患者认知功能的相关程度尚不清楚.了解淀粉样蛋白病理学和认知功能之间的关系对于更好地理解AD的病程和设计AD预防试验是很重要的。纵向纵向研究4 - 6揭示了淀粉样病变和长期认知功能下降之间的联系。为了评估认知筛查作为丰富AD临床试验的工具的作用，还需要建立横向联系。然而，认知正常个体4，7，8和MCI患者7，9，10的横向研究结果并不一致。这种变异性可能是由于不同研究在人口统计学和遗传因素、疾病分期和储备能力以及方法学途径上的差异造成的。效应主要在发作记忆和整体认知领域观察到，并且往往很小，11表明需要大样本来研究淀粉样蛋白认知关联。 We previously estimated the prevalence of amyloid positivity in persons without dementia and, in the present study, investigated the association between amyloid positivity and cognitive scores in this population by using individual participant data from 53 studies included in the *multicenter* *Amyloid Biomarker Study*. We also examined whether age, cognitive status, sex,educational level, andapolipoproteinE (APOE) genotype modify the association betweenamyloid status and global cognition or episodic memory; estimated temporal associations among amyloid positivity, low memory scores, and AD-type dementia; and tested the usefulness of cognitive scores as a screening instrument for amyloid positivity. 我们先前估计了非痴呆患者中淀粉样蛋白阳性的患病率，在本研究中，通过使用多中心淀粉样蛋白生物标志物研究中53项研究的个体参与者数据，研究了该人群中淀粉样蛋白阳性与认知评分之间的关系。和载脂蛋白E（APOE）基因型改变类淀粉状态与整体认知或情景记忆之间的关联;淀粉样蛋白阳性、低记忆评分和AD型痴呆之间的时间关联性估计;并测试了认知评分作为淀粉样蛋白阳性筛查工具的有效性。

Participants were recruited from studies that participated in the multicenter Amyloid Biomarker Study1 on establishing the prevalence of amyloid pathology measured with a positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker. For details onstudy selection anddata collection, see Jansen et al.1 Study inclusion began in 2012and is ongoing. At time of analysis (January 2017), we included participantlevel data from 2908 participants with normal cognition and 4133 patients with MCI from 53 studies that had data available on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)and/or an episodicmemoryscore. Participants with normalc ognition had no cognitive concerns for which medical help was sought and scored within the normal range on cognitive tests. The diagnosis of MCI was madea ccording to published criteria, including subjectively experienced and objectively verified decline inmemoryor another cognitivedomain.Characteristics ofthe included studies are given in eTable 1 in the Supplement. All participants gave written informedconsent to participate, and datawere deidentified. Study protocolswere approvedby the local ethicscommittees ofall centers participating intheAmyloid Biomarker Study. 参与者是从参与多中心淀粉样蛋白生物标志物研究1的研究中招募的，该研究通过正电子发射断层扫描（PET）或脑脊液（CSF）生物标志物测定淀粉样蛋白病理学的患病率。有关研究选择和数据收集的详细信息，请参见Jansen et al.1研究纳入始于2012年，目前正在进行中。在分析时（2017年1月），我们纳入了来自53项研究的2908名认知正常的参与者和4133名MCI患者的参与者水平数据，这些研究具有简易精神状态检查（MMSE）和/或发作记忆评分的数据。认知正常的参与者没有寻求医疗帮助的认知问题，并且在认知测试的正常范围内得分。MCI的诊断是根据公布的标准进行的，包括主观经历和客观证实的记忆或另一种认知领域的下降。纳入研究的特征见补充资料中的表1。所有参与者都提供了书面知情同意书，并且数据被去识别化。研究方案由参与淀粉样蛋白生物标志物研究的所有中心的当地伦理委员会批准。

Global cognition was assessed with the MMSE.12 The MMSE scores were available from 53 studies comprising a total of 2885 participants with normal cognition (38 studies) and 4133 patients with MCI (48 studies). *A low MMSE score was defined as 27 or less*. Episodic memory was assessed with verbal word learning tests.Data were available from 31 studies including 2010 participants with normal cognition (21 studies) and 2615 patients with MCI(26 studies). Most studies provided rawscores (28 studies) thatweretransformedintozscoresusingthemeanandSDofthe center-specific groupofcognitively unimpaired individuals or, in the absence of such a group, using published test-specific means.Threestudiesprovidedzscoresthatwerecalculatedsimilarly. Episodic memory was assessed using 12 different verbal memory tests of immediate or delayed recall. When multiple memorytest scoreswereprovidedforaparticipant, thedelayed recallscorewaschosen.Tests of delayed recall were used for 2809 participants(21studies)and tests of immediate recall for 1816 participants(10studies). SeeeTable2 in the Supplement for an overview of the memory tests used in each study. In our analyses,*low episodic memory performance* was defined as a *zscore of −1.28 or less*, capturing performance in the 10th percentile or lower of the population mean. 总体认知能力采用MMSE进行评估。12 MMSE评分来自53项研究，包括2885名认知能力正常的参与者（38项研究）和4133名MCI患者（48项研究）。低MMSE评分被定义为27分或更低。情景记忆采用言语词汇学习测试进行评估。数据来自31项研究，包括2010名认知正常的参与者（21项研究）和2615例MCI患者（26项研究）。大多数研究提供了原始评分（28项研究），这些研究转换为z评分，反映了认知未受损个体的中心特异性组的平均值和SD，或者，在不存在此类组的情况下，使用已发表的特定测试方法。三项研究提供了计算相似的z评分。使用12种不同的即时或延迟回忆的言语记忆测试来评估情景记忆。当为参与者提供多项记忆测试分数时，选择延迟回忆分数。延迟回忆测试用于2809名参与者（21项研究），而即时回忆测试用于1816名参与者（10项研究）。每项研究所用记忆测试的概述见附录中的表2。在我们的分析中，低情节记忆表现被定义为azscore为-1.28或更低，表现在人群平均值的第10百分位或更低。

In the sample selected for these analyses, amyloid pathology was assessed with amyloid-PET in 1224 participants with normal cognition (21 studies) and 956 patients with MCI(23 studies) and by amyloid-β1-42 level in CSF in 1684 participants with normal cognition (19 studies) and 3177 with MCI (29 studies). Measurement details have been described previously.1 The *PET and CSF biomarkers were dichotomized as negative (normal) or positive (abnormal)* according to study-specific cutoffs or visual reads. Information on the *level of education* was available for 2558 participants (88.0%) with normal cognition (memory score: n = 1973;MMSE:n = 2536) and 3270 patients (79.1%)with MCI (memory score: n = 2456; MMSE: n = 3264). Information on APOE-ε4 carrier status (yes or no) was available for 2400 participants (82.5%) with normal cognition (memory score: n = 1764;MMSE:n = 2379) and 3292 patients (79.7%) with MCI (memory score: n = 2217; MMSE: n = 3286). The APOE genotype was available for 2347 participants (80.7%) with normal cognition(memoryscore:n = 1763;MMSE:n = 2326) and 3019 patients (73.0%) with MCI (memory score: n = 2215; MMSE: n = 3013). 

To provide an estimation of the **temporal associations** among amyloid positivity, low memory scores, and AD-type dementia, we *compared age-specific frequency* estimates of *low memory scores* and *amyloid positivity* in participants with *normal cognition* with age-specific prevalence data of AD-type dementia in the general population (adopted from Jansen et al1).   

To investigate the **screening potential of low cognitive scores**, we calculated the *odds of low cognitive performance for amyloid positivity* and examined *improvement in area under the receiver operating* characteristic curve when cognitive scores were added to a model with age and APOE-ε4 carrier status. 

Differences in clinical and demographic characteristics between the amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative subgroups were analyzed using analyses of variance for continuous variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables. Dichotomized MMSE and memory scores (low vs normal) were used as outcome variables in generalized estimating equations. *Generalized estimating equations* allow for the analysis of binary correlated  data such that participant-level data from all studies could be modeled simultaneously while *accounting for the clustering of participants within studies*. We assumed a logit link function for binary outcome with an exchangeable correlation structure to account for within-study correlation. *Age* was included as a continuous measure and was *centered at the median*. **Educational level was dichotomized at the median** (high （≥14 years] vsmoderate to low（<14 years]). For each outcomemeasure,we performed the following 6 models. The first model included amyloid pathology (present or absent), cognitivestatus(normal cognition or MCI),age, interactions among these 3 variables as predictors, and sex and educational level as covariates. In the second, third, and fourth models, we added sex (model 2), educational level (model 3), and APOE-ε4 carrier status(model4)with up to 3-way interactions of these variables with amyloid pathology, cognitive status, and age. In the fifth model, we entered all variables and included up to 3-way interactions among age, sex, educational level, APOE-ε4 carrier status, cognitive status,andamyloi dpathology using a forward selection method. In the sixth model, we examined whether APOE genotype (coded as ε4ε4, ε2ε4/ε3ε4, ε3ε3, or  ε2ε2/ε2ε3) modified the associationamong amyloid, age, and cognition while correcting for sex and educational level. Terms were retained in the equation in case of a significant Wald statistic (P < .05). For an overview of significant terms in each of the models tested, see **eTable 3** in the Supplement. We report estimates corrected for age, sex, and educational level in the text. Models unadjusted for sex and educational level yielded similar results and were used to display estimates in Figures 1, 2, 3 and Table 1 and Table 2. Associations did not change after correcting for multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni method. Secondary analyses are described in eAppendix 1 and eFigure3 in the Supplement. Analyses were conducted with SPSS statistical software, version 22.0 (IBM Corp), with a significance level set at P < .05 for unpaired, 2-sided tests. 

### Results
![[Pasted image 20230410110113.png|800]]
Amyloid positivity was differentially associated with low memory scores across age and diagnostic groups (3-way interaction; β = −0.54(95%CI,−0.097 to−0.011]). In participants with normal cognition, low memory scores were more frequent in amyloid-positive than in amyloid-negative participants but only after 70 years of age (mean difference for amyloid-positive vs amyloid-negative participants at 72 years of age, 4%(95%CI,0%7%],P = .04; at 90 years of age, 21%(95%CI,10%-33%],P < .001). At 80 years of age, the frequency of low memory scores in amyloid-positive participants with normal cognition was almost double that of their amyloid-negative counterparts (25%vs14%) (Figure 1A and Table 2). In patients with MCI, amyloid-positive participants more often had low memory scores than amyloid negative participants (mean difference,16%(95%CI,12%-20%],  P < .001) (Figure 1B and Table 2), although this difference decreased with advancing age. *In participants with normal cognition and patients with MCI*, sex, educational level, and APOE-ε4 carrier status were each associate**d with memory scores but did not moderate the association between amyloid status and memory scores** (eFigure1A in the Supplement). A low memory score was more frequent in men than in women (mean difference, 8% (95% CI, 3%-14%], P = .004), in participants with low rather than high educational level (mean difference, 8% (95% CI, 5%-11%], P < .001), and in APOE-ε4 carriers than in noncarriers (mean difference, 8% (95% CI, 4%-11%], P < .001). Furthermore, APOE genotype was associated with low memory score independent of amyloid status, cognitive status, or age (Figure 2). Participants with the APOE-ε4ε4 genotype most often had a lowmemory score (mean difference vs ε2ε4/ε3ε4,10%(95%CI, 4%-16%],P < .001; vs ε3ε3, 16%(95% CI, 9%-24%], P < .001; vs ε2ε2/ε2ε3, 21% (95% CI, 9%-24%], P < .001), followed by participants with the APOE-ε2ε4/ε3ε4 genotype (mean difference vs ε3ε3, 6% (95% CI, 3%-9%], P < .001; vs ε2ε2/ε2ε3, 11%(95%CI 4%-17%],P = .001) and the APOE-ε3ε3 and APOE-ε2ε2/ε2ε3 genotypes (mean difference, 5% (95% CI, −1% to 10%], P = .09). The association between amyloid positivity and a low score on the MMSE was dependent on age (β = 0.023 (95% CI, 0.009-0.037], P = .001 for interaction) and cognitive status (β = 0.348 (95%CI,0.032-0.665], P = .03 for interaction; β = 0.006(95% CI, −0.033 to 0.044], P = .10 for 3-way interaction). In participants with normal cognition, amyloid positivity was not associated with low MMSE scores at any age (mean difference, 3%(95%CI, −1%to6%],P = .16) (Figure 1C and Table 2). In patients with MCI, the frequency of low MMSE scores was greater in amyloid-positive compared with amyloid-negative patients at all ages (mean difference, 14% (95% CI, 12%-17%], P < .001) (Figure 1D and Table 2). When adjusting for sex, educational level, and APOE-ε4 carrier status, none of these factors modulated the association between amyloid status and MMSE score in participants with normal cognition or patientswith MCI. APOE-ε4 carriership was more often associated with low MMSE scores regardless of cognitive status and age (mean difference, 4%(95%CI, 2%-7%],P < .001). Sex (β = −0.444 (95%CI, −0.681 to−0.207]; P<.001 for interaction) and educational level (β = −0.554(95% CI, −0.874 to −0.234], P<.001 for interaction) had an association with MMSE score that was dependent on cognitive status (eFigure 1B in the Supplement). In addition, APOE genotype was associated with low MMSE score (P = .002) (eFigure 2 in the Supplement) independent of amyloid status, cognitive status, and age. Participants with the APOE-ε4ε4 genotype most often had a low MMSE score (mean difference vs ε2ε4/ε3ε4, 6% (95% CI, 0%-12%], P = .06; vs ε3ε3, 10% (95% CI, 3%-16%], P = .005; vs ε2ε2/ε2ε3, 10% (95% CI, 3%-16%], P = .005) followed by participants with the APOE-ε2ε4/ε3ε4 genotype (mean difference vs ε3ε3, 4% (95% CI, 1%-6%], P = .008; vs  ε2ε2/ε2ε3, 4% (95% CI, 1%-8%], P = .14) and the APOE-ε3ε3 and APOE-ε2ε2/ε2ε3 genotypes (mean difference, 0% (95% CI, −4% to 4%], P = .99).

### Intro
To test the hypothesis that years of formal education modifies the relation of AD pathology to level of cognitive function. Methods: A total of 130 older Catholic clergy participating in the *Religious Orders Study* underwent annual cognitive function testing and brain autopsy at the time of death. Individual *cognitive* function tests were *z-scored and averaged* to yield a global measure of cognitive function and summary measures of five different cognitive abilities. Neuritic and diffuse plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were counted in separate 1 $mm^2$ areas of maximal density. Counts were converted to standard scores by dividing by their SD, and combined to yield a global AD pathology score and summary scores of each postmortem index. Linear regression was used to examine the relation of education and AD pathology scores to level of cognitive function proximate to death, controlling for age and sex. Subsequent analyses tested the interaction between education and each AD pathology score to determine whether education modified the relation of AD pathology to level of cognitive function. Additional analyses examined these associations on five specific cognitive abilities. Results: Both years of formal education (regression coefficient =0.073, p = 0.0001) and the global AD pathology score (regression coefficient = -0.689, p < 0.0001) were related to level of cognitive function. When an interaction term between education and AD pathology was added to the model, the association between a unit of AD pathology and level of cognitive function was 0.088 (p = 0.0078) standard unit less for each year of education than the level predicted from the model without the interaction term. Whereas neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles were all strongly related to cognitive function, education only modified the relation of neuritic plaques (p = 0.002) and diffuse plaques (p = 0.03) to cognition, but not neurofibrillary tangles. In analyses examining five different cognitive abilities, the interaction between education and the neuritic plaque score was strongest for perceptual speed and weakest for episodic memory. Conclusions: These data provide strong evidence that the relation between senile plaques and level of cognitive function differs by years of formal education.
目的:检验正规教育年限对AD病理与认知功能水平关系的影响。方法:参与宗教秩序研究的130名年长的天主教神职人员每年接受认知功能测试和死亡时的脑解剖。对个体认知功能测试进行z评分，并取其平均值，得出认知功能的整体衡量标准，以及五种不同认知能力的总结衡量标准。神经炎和弥漫性斑块和神经纤维缠结在最大密度为1mm2的单独区域进行计数。通过除以他们的SD将计数转换为标准分数，并结合得出一个总体AD病理分数和每个死后指标的总结分数。采用线性回归分析教育程度和AD病理评分与接近死亡的认知功能水平之间的关系，控制年龄和性别。随后的分析测试了教育与每个AD病理评分之间的交互作用，以确定教育是否改变了AD病理与认知功能水平的关系。额外的分析检查了五种特定认知能力的这些关联。结果:正规教育年限(回归系数⫽0.073,p⫽0.0001)和AD总体病理评分(回归系数⫽⫺0.689,p⬍0.0001)均与认知功能水平相关。当将教育与AD病理的交互项添加到模型中，每一年教育的AD病理单位与认知功能水平之间的关联比没有交互项的模型预测的水平低0.088 (p⫽0.0078)标准单位。尽管神经炎斑块、弥漫性斑块和神经原纤维缠结都与认知功能密切相关，但教育只改变了神经炎斑块(p⫽0.002)和弥漫性斑块(p⫽0.03)与认知功能的关系，而没有改变神经原纤维缠结。在五种不同认知能力的分析中，教育和神经炎斑块得分之间的交互作用在感知速度方面最强，在情景记忆方面最弱。结论:这些数据提供了强有力的证据，表明老年斑与认知功能水平之间的关系因教育年限的不同而不同。

Recent data demonstrate that some people with extensive AD pathology (senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) do not exhibit cognitive impairment. This observation suggests that people differ in their capacity to withstand the deleterious effects of these pathologic indices. Identifying factors associated with the ability to tolerate the accumulation of AD pathology has important implications for disease prevention. One such factor could be years of formal education. Education is related to level of cognitive function among older persons with and without AD and it is now generally accepted that education, and variables related to education such as cognitive activities, are associated with a reduced risk of AD. The neurobiologic mechanisms responsible for the association between education and cognitive impairment are not known. One possibility is that education directly impacts the rate at which plaques and tangles accumulate in the brain. One study restricted to persons with clinically diagnosed dementia did not find a relation between education and plaques or tangles. By contrast, another study found a relation between early life linguistic ability and density of neurofibrillary tangles. Another possibility is that education, or related variables, can somehow delay disease onset without directly impacting the accumulation of AD pathology, perhaps by increasing the reserve capacity of the brain. For example, a larger brain might be able to tolerate more pathology before reaching a critical threshold when cognitive impairment becomes clinically evident. One study found that 10 persons with significant AD pathology who did not have dementia had larger brains and greater density of neurons than persons without AD pathology. Neuroimaging studies also report associations between brain volume and dementia.15 We used clinical and postmortem data from older persons participating in the Reli- gious Orders Study, a longitudinal clinical- pathologic study of aging and AD, to test the hypothesis that years of formal education modifies the relation between AD pathology and cognitive function.
最近的数据表明，一些患有广泛的AD病理(老年斑和神经原纤维缠结)的人没有表现出认知障碍。1-4这一观察结果表明，人们抵御这些病理指标的有害影响的能力是不同的。识别与AD病理积累耐受能力相关的因素对疾病预防具有重要意义。其中一个因素可能是多年的正规教育。教育程度与老年人的认知功能水平有关有AD5和没有ad6的老年人的认知功能水平现在人们普遍认为教育，以及与教育有关的变量，如认知活动，7-9教育与认知障碍之间的关系的神经生物学机制尚不清楚。一种可能是，教育直接影响斑块和缠结在大脑中的积累速度。一项仅限于临床诊断的痴呆症患者的研究没有发现教育与斑块或神经缠结之间的关系相反，另一项研究发现，早期生命的语言能力与神经纤维缠结密度之间存在联系另一种可能性是，教育或相关变量可以在不直接影响AD病理积累的情况下，以某种方式延迟疾病的发作，可能是通过增加大脑的储备容量。例如，当认知障碍出现临床症状时，在达到临界阈值之前，更大的大脑可能能够承受更多的病理变化。一项研究发现，10个有显著阿尔茨海默病病理但没有痴呆的人比没有阿尔茨海默病的人有更大的大脑和更大的神经元密度神经影像学研究也报告了脑容量和痴呆症之间的联系我们使用了参加宗教教令研究的老年人的临床和尸检数据，这是一项关于衰老和AD的纵向临床病理学研究，以验证正式教育年限改变了AD病理和认知功能之间的关系。

All subjects were older Catholic nuns, priests, and brothers who agreed to annual clinical evaluations and brain donation at the time of death. Subjects come from about 40 groups across the United States (see Acknowledgment). Each participant signed an informed consent and an Anatomic Gift Act donating his or her brain to Rush investigators at the time of death. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Medical Center. Since January 1994, more than 950 persons enrolled in the study and were evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive impairment. The overall follow-up rate exceeds 95% of survivors. Through February 2002 when these analyses were performed, a total of 192 participants had died and 177 (92.2%) had undergone brain autopsy. Brain autopsy information was available for analysis from the first (consecutive) 142 persons (as the study has a rolling admission, postmortem data collection was ongoing for the remaining 35 persons).所有的研究对象都是年长的天主教修女、牧师和同意每年进行临床评估并在死亡时捐献大脑的兄弟。实验对象来自美国各地大约40个群体(见致谢)。每位参与者都签署了知情同意书和《解剖捐赠法案》，在死亡时将自己的大脑捐赠给拉什研究人员。这项研究是由Rush presbyteriam - st。卢克医疗中心。自1994年1月以来，超过950人参与了这项研究，并对AD和其他认知障碍原因进行了评估。总的随访率超过95%的幸存者。到2002年2月进行这些分析时，共有192名参与者死亡，177人(92.2%)进行了脑解剖。第一例(连续)142例患者的脑解剖信息可供分析(由于该研究采用滚动入院，其余35例患者的尸检数据正在收集中)。

Because we wanted to determine whether education modified the relation of AD pathology to cognitive function, only *persons without dementia (n =79)* and those with *clinically diagnosed AD (n =51)* were included in the analyses. Twelve persons with clinical conditions other than AD thought to be contributing to, or causing, cognitive impairment were excluded from all analyses (eight with AD and another condition and four with dementia due to another condition). Thus, 130 persons, *62 men and 68 women*, were included in the analyses. They underwent cognitive function testing about 8 months before death (median = 8.0, 90th percentile = 14.0 months). The primary outcome measure was level of global cognitive function proximate to death. We chose this outcome over clinically diagnosed AD for two reasons. First, because dementia is defined as a loss of cognitive function from a previously higher level and education is strongly related to premorbid level of cognition, the clinical diagnosis of dementia and AD is either explicitly or implicitly adjusted for years of education. Second, because the association of education with level of cognitive function has been well documented among older persons with and without AD,5,6 and because the pathology of AD is well known to accumulate before the onset of overt dementia,1-4 using level of cognitive function as the outcome allowed us to examine the full spectrum of both pathology and cognition, and their association with education, in the most direct way and with the greatest statistical power.
因为我们想确定教育是否能改变AD病理与认知功能的关系，所以我们只将没有痴呆的人(n⫽79)和临床诊断为AD的人(n⫽51)纳入分析。12名非阿尔茨海默氏症患者被认为是导致或导致认知障碍的原因，被排除在所有分析之外(8名阿尔茨海默氏症患者和另一种疾病，4名因另一种疾病导致的痴呆)。因此，分析包括了130人，62名男子和68名妇女。他们在死亡前8个月接受了认知功能测试(中位数⫽8.0,90百分位⫽14.0个月)。主要结果测量是接近死亡时的全球认知功能水平。我们选择这个结果而不是临床诊断的AD有两个原因。首先，由于痴呆症被定义为一种认知功能的丧失，而教育程度与发病前的认知水平密切相关，痴呆和AD的临床诊断要么明确要么隐含地根据多年的教育进行调整。Second，因为教育与认知功能水平的关系在老年痴呆症患者和非老年痴呆症患者中已经被很好地证明了，5,6，因为众所周知，AD的病理在显性痴呆发作之前就已经积累，1-4，使用认知功能水平作为结果，我们可以检查病理和非痴呆的全谱认知，以及他们与教育的联系，以最直接的方式，以最强大的统计力量。

Each subject underwent a uniform structured clinical evaluation that included the procedures recommended by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD (CERAD).18 The evaluation included a medical history, neurologic examination, neuropsychological performance testing, and review of a brain scan when available. *Years of formal education* was determined with the education question from the 1990 US Census. Cognitive performance tests were reviewed by a boardcertified neuropsychologist. Participants were evaluated in person by a board certified or board eligible neurologist or geriatrician with expertise in the evaluation of older persons with and without dementia. Based on this evaluation, participants were classified with respect to AD and other common conditions with the potential to impair cognitive function. Details of the evaluation have been described.19 The diagnosis of dementia and AD followed the recommendations of the joint working group of the National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the AD and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA).20 Follow-up evaluations, identical in all essential details, were performed annually by examiners blinded to previously collected data. At the time of death, all available clinical data were reviewed by persons blinded to all postmortem data, and a summary diagnostic opinion was rendered regarding the most likely clinical diagnosis at the time of death.
每个受试者都进行了统一的结构化临床评估，其中包括建立AD注册联盟(CERAD)推荐的程序评估包括病史、神经检查、神经心理性能测试，并在可能时复查脑部扫描。正式教育的年限由1990年美国人口普查的教育问题决定。认知能力测试由一名委员会认证的神经心理学家进行评估。参与者由经过认证的委员会或在评估患有或没有痴呆症的老年人方面具有专业知识的合格神经学家或老年病学专家亲自进行评估。在此评估的基础上，参与者根据AD和其他可能损害认知功能的常见疾病进行分类。评价的细节已经说明痴呆和AD的诊断遵循了国家神经和沟通障碍和中风研究所以及AD和相关疾病协会联合工作组的建议所有基本细节相同的随访评估，每年由检查人员进行，对以前收集的数据不知情。在死亡时，所有可获得的临床资料均由对所有死后资料一无所知的人进行审查，并就死亡时最可能的临床诊断提出简要诊断意见。

Cognitive function tests were selected to assess a broad range of cognitive abilities commonly affected by aging and AD. The Mini-Mental State Examination was used to describe the cohort but was not used in analyses. *Nineteen* cognitive function tests were used to create a *global* measure of cognition and separate summary measures of five different cognitive abilities. There were *seven tests of episodic memory* (Word List Memory, Recall, and Recognition and immediate and delayed recall of two brief stories); *four tests of semantic memory* (Verbal Fluency and short forms of the Boston Naming Test, National Adult Reading Test, and Extended Range Vocabulary); *four tests of working memory* (Digit Span Forward and Backward, Digit Ordering, and Alpha Span); *two tests of perceptual speed* (Symbol Digit Modalities Test and Number Comparison); and *two tests of visuospatial ability* (short forms of Judgment of Line Orientation and Standard Progressive Matrices). Previously established composite measures of global cognition, based on all 19 tests, and of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability, based on subsets of two to seven tests, were used in analyses rather than individual test scores. *Each composite* measure was computed by converting raw scores on each component test to *z scores*, using the baseline mean and SD for all participants in the Religious Orders Study, and *averaging the z scores* to yield the composite measure. Further information about the individual tests and the derivation of the composite measures is published elsewhere.

Brains from all participating sites were removed in a standard fashion as previously reported. After fixation in paraformaldehyde for 3 to 14 days, tissue from the midfrontal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus, the inferior parietal gyrus, and the entorhinal cortex was paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 6 𝞵m, and stained with a modified Bielschowsky silver stain. Neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and *neurofibrillary tangles* were counted by a board-certified neuropathologist or a trained technician as previously described. *Diffuse plaques* were recognized by their discrete brownish discoloration. *Neuritic plaques* were distinguished from diffuse plaques by requiring thickened argyrophilic neurites with and without central cores of amyloid. Although upper and lower limit size cutoffs for plaques were not used, contiguous clusters and confluent plaques were split into individual components and counted separately if possible. To estimate the density of each pathologic index, the entire slide was first examined under low power at a total magnification of 20 or 40 Xand the region that appeared to have the greatest density of pathology was identified. The total number of neuritic plaques was counted at a magnification of 100 X using a graticule to mark a one square millimeter area. The same procedure was followed for all three pathologic indices in each of the four cortical regions resulting in 12 individual measures of pathology for each person. Note that this procedure means that neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles were unlikely to come from the same location on each slide. The inter-rater reliability of counts of neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles ranged from r =0.89 to r = 0.93 on 40 cases, supporting the reproducibility of these measures. Previously es- tablished composite measures of global AD pathology and of com- posite summary measures of neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles based on counts from each of the four brain regions were used in analyses rather than the raw variables. The *scaled score for each neuropathologic* count in each region was computed by dividing each raw count by the SD of the mean for the same neuropathologic index in that region in the first 142 deceased participants in the Religious Orders Study. The scaled scores were *then averaged* to yield the *composite* measures. Four composite scores, including global AD pathology score, a neuritic plaque score, a diffuse plaque score, and neurofibrillary tangle score, were derived in this way for each subject. This procedure markedly reduced the right skew of the count data. The inter-correlations among the three indices ranged from 0.43 to 0.61 (all p < 0.0001) suggesting that they could be combined for the summary measure of AD pathology but could also be dissociable. Further information about the derivation of the composite measures is published elsewhere.如先前报道的那样，以标准方式移除所有参与站点的大脑。 在多聚甲醛中固定 3 至 14 天后，将额中回、颞上回、顶下回和内嗅皮层的组织石蜡包埋，以 6 µm 切片，并用改良的 Bielschowsky 银染剂染色。 36 如前所述，神经炎斑块、弥漫性斑块和神经原纤维缠结由委员会认证的神经病理学家或训练有素的技术人员进行计数。 弥漫性斑块通过其不连续的褐色变色来识别。 神经炎斑块与弥漫性斑块的区别在于需要增厚的嗜银神经突，有和没有淀粉样蛋白的中央核心。 尽管没有使用斑块的上限和下限大小截止值，但如果可能的话，连续的簇和融合的斑块被分成单独的部分并单独计数。 为估计每个病理指标的密度，首先在低倍率下以 20 或 40 X 的总放大倍率检查整个载玻片，并确定似乎具有最大病理密度的区域。 使用标线标记一平方毫米的区域，在放大 100 倍的情况下计算神经炎斑块的总数。 对四个皮质区域中的每一个的所有三个病理指标都遵循相同的程序，从而为每个人产生 12 个单独的病理测量值。 请注意，此过程意味着神经炎斑块、弥漫性斑块和神经原纤维缠结不太可能来自每张幻灯片上的相同位置。 在 40 个病例中，神经炎斑块、弥漫性斑块和神经原纤维缠结计数的评估者间可靠性范围为 r = 0.89 至 r = 0.93，支持这些措施的可重复性。 先前建立的整体 AD 病理学综合测量和神经炎斑块、弥漫性斑块和神经原纤维缠结的综合综合测量基于四个大脑区域中每个区域的计数，用于分析而不是原始变量。 每个区域每个神经病理学计数的比例分数是通过将每个原始计数除以宗教秩序研究中前 142 名已故参与者在该区域相同神经病理学指数的平均值的标准差来计算的。 然后对标度分数进行平均以产生综合测量值。 四个综合评分，包括整体 AD 病理评分、神经炎斑评分、弥漫性斑评分和神经原纤维缠结评分，以这种方式为每个受试者得出。 此过程显着减少了计数数据的右偏斜。 三个指数之间的相关性范围为 0.43 到 0.61（所有 p < 0.0001）表明它们可以组合用于 AD 病理学的总结测量，但也可以是可分离的。 有关综合措施推导的更多信息在别处公布。

The distributions of the cognitive function measures and neuropathologic indices at the last evaluation before death are shown in table 1. Higher scores denote better cognitive performance and more pathology. The mean scores on the cognitive tests were below zero because the standardized z-scores were based on the mean and SD from the baseline evaluation of all participants in the Religious Orders Study.

We first used *multiple linear regression models* to examine the extent to which years of formal education and the global pathology score were related to level of global *cognitive function assessed proximate to death*. The next set of analyses examined whether the relation between global pathology score and global cognitive function varied at different levels of education. For these analyses we constructed linear regression models that included terms for education, pathology, and their interaction. The interaction term directly tests the hypothesis that each year of education modifies the effect of a unit of pathology on level of cognitive function. To see if the effects were present for some types of pathology but not others, we repeated these analyses with scaled scores of neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. To determine whether education modified the relation of pathology to some cognitive abilities but not others, we subsequently examined the relation of the pathology scores to separate summary measures of five different cognitive abilities. *All models adjusted for age and sex* and were validated graphically and analytically. All analyses were carried out using SAS/STAT software version 8 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)38 on a SunUltraSparc workstation.

Education and global AD pathology. We first examined whether education was directly related to measures of AD pathology in linear regression models controlling for age and sex. Years of education was not related to the global AD pathology score or to the scaled scores of neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, or neurofibrillary tangles (correlations ranged from r = -0.008 to -0.02, all p values >0.25). This suggests that any association between education and cognitive function must be the result of some mechanism other than the traditional pathologic markers of AD.

Education, global AD pathology, and global cognitive function. We next examined whether years of formal education and the global measure of AD pathology were related to level of global cognitive function assessed proximate to death. We constructed a linear regression model that included terms for education and the global pathology score as a function of global cognition, controlling for age and sex. In these analyses, each year of education was associated with a 0.073 unit higher global cognitive score and each unit of AD pathology was associated with 0.689 unit lower global cognitive score (table 2, model 1). These data seem to suggest that education provides a fixed cognitive advantage regardless of the amount of pathology. However, when a term for the interaction between education and the global pathology score was added to the regression model, it became clear that the association of pa- thology with cognitive function differed by years of education. Specifically, for each additional year of education, the impact of one unit of global pathology on level of cognitive function was 0.088 (p =0.002) standard unit less than the level predicted from the model without the interaction term (see table 2, model 2). To illustrate this effect, we plotted the predicted relation between the global pathology score and the global cognitive score for participants with 22 years (90th percentile), 18 years (50th percentile), and 15 years (10th percentile) of education (figure 1). If education provided a fixed cognitive advantage regardless of the amount of pathology the lines would be parallel. The divergence of the lines demonstrates that the association of pathology with cognitive function is different for persons with more years of education compared to those with fewer years. 

Education, plaques and tangles, and global cognitive function. We next conducted three separate sets of analyses to exam- ine level of global cognition as a function of education and each specific measure of AD pathology. In the first analysis, each year of education was associated with about a 0.078 (p < 0.0001) unit higher global cognitive score and each unit of neuritic plaques was associated with a 0.460 (p <0.0001) unit lower global cognitive score (see table 2, model 1). When a term for the interaction between education and neuritic plaques was added to the regression model, the impact of one unit of neuritic plaque on level of cognitive function was 0.092 (p =0.002) standard unit less than the level predicted from the model without the interaction term (see table 2, model 2). We illustrated this effect by plotting the predicted relation between level of cognition and the neuritic plaque score for participants with 22 years (90th percentile), 18 years (50th percentile), and 15 years (10th percentile) of education (figure 2, top). As seen for the global measure of AD pathology, the figure demonstrates that the association of neuritic plaques with cognitive function differed by years of education. Similar results were found in analyses of diffuse plaques. Each unit of diffuse plaques was associated with a 0.394 (p < 0.0001) unit lower global cognitive score (see table 2, model 2). When a term for the interac- tion between education and diffuse plaques was added to the regression model, the impact of one unit of diffuse plaque on level of cognitive function was 0.062 (p = 0.025) standard unit less than the level predicted from the model without the interaction term (see table 2, model 2). We illustrated this effect by plotting the predicted relation between level of cognition and the diffuse plaque score for participants with 22 years, 18 years, and 15 years of education (see figure 2, middle). Again, the divergence of the lines demonstrates that the association of diffuse plaques with cognitive function differed by years of education. In analyses of neurofibrillary tangles, each unit of tangles was associated with a 0.511 (p < 0.0001) unit lower global cognitive score (see table 2, model 1). However, when a term for the interaction between education and tangles was added to the regression model, the interac- tion term was not significant, indicating that education did not modify the effect of neurofibrillary tangles on cognition (see table 2, model 2). The absence of an interaction effect is evident in figure 2, bottom, which shows parallel lines for the three educa- tion groups, suggesting that education provides a fixed cognitive advantage but does not modify the relation of neurofibrillary tangles to cognition.

Memory and other forms of cognition are not unitary processes, but dissociable systems that mediate different types of information processing. To see if education modified the relation between neuritic plaques and some forms of cognition but not others, a similar set of analyses was conducted separately for five different summary measures of cognitive function assessed proximate to death, controlling for age and sex. The first set of analyses examined the independent effects of education and neuritic plaques. Each addi- tional year of education was associated with higher scores on all five abilities ranging from 0.067 unit for working memory to 0.084 unit for semantic memory (table 3, model 1). Each additional unit of neuritic plaques was associated with lower scores on each cognitive measure, ranging from -0.227 unit for visuospatial ability to -0.699 unit for episodic memory (see table 3, model 1). We then added a term to each model for the interaction between education and the neuritic plaque score. Education modified the relation of neuritic plaques to all five cognitive abilities (see table 3, model 2). The effect was most robust for perceptual speed, followed by se- mantic memory and working memory, and weakest for episodic memory and visuospatial ability. Similar analyses were performed for measures of diffuse plaques. There was a significant interaction between education and diffuse plaques for working memory and perceptual speed but not for the other three cognitive domains (data not shown).

### Discussion
Our findings suggest that the relation between senile plaques and level of cognitive function differs by level of education. This suggests that education not only provides a cognitive advantage such that persons with more years of education have higher levels of cognitive function throughout adult life and therefore require more pathology to reach any given level of cognitive impairment, but that education also somehow modifies the effect of AD pathology on cognition. The effect of education was relatively specific for neuritic and diffuse plaques as opposed to neurofibrillary tangles. Furthermore, it affected several different cognitive abilities, although not equally. These data provide strong evidence that formal education, or something related to education, provides some type of cognitive or neural reserve that reduces the deleterious effect of senile plaques on cognitive abilities.

The concept of reserve applies to many human physiologic systems. Most physiologic systems are highly redundant such that a considerable amount of tissue destruction must take place before their func- tion is compromised and signs and symptoms of disease become clinically evident. Although the nervous system is structurally and functionally complex, reserve capacity has long been hypothesized to protect the human brain from expressing the pathology of AD as impaired cognitive function.

Education can influence the functional organiza- tion of the human brain.39 Although the biologic mechanisms underlying this capacity are unknown, the results of studies with experimental animals over the past two decades provide clues. The nervous system is organized into interconnected functional neural systems (e.g., cognitive, motor, sensory) that work both in parallel and in series. Like other phys- iologic systems, redundancy within each system is present at all levels—structural, biochemical, and molecular. Several cellular and subcellular struc- tural components of neural systems are crucial for the efficient performance of each functional system, including neurons, synapses, dendrites, and den- dritic spines. These structural components vary among individuals, and are a function not only of genetic endowment, but also of experience during development and adulthood. Education and related cognitive experiences may lead to greater redun- dancy in neural circuits involved in cognition thereby rendering these systems less vulnerable to pathol- ogy. It is well known that environmental enrichment induces a variety of neuroplastic responses such as synaptogenesis and neurogenesis in young, adult, and aged animals, including nonhuman primates.40,41 Although this neuroplastic effect appears to be most pronounced during development, work with experi- mental animals suggests that neural circuits are not static but capable of ongoing plasticity in adult and aged animals, and that the neuroplastic responses from environmental enrichment are functional42 and can be sustained over time.43 Navigational experiences have also been related to the volume of selected brain structures (e.g., posterior hippocampus) in humans lending further support to the idea that human brain structure may be altered by experience.44
 
Because education appears to modify the relation of senile plaques to cognitive function rather than simply providing a fixed cognitive advantage, it is possible that education, or factors related to educa- tion, induce a similar neuroplastic response in hu- mans. Studies of persons recovering from stroke or injury demonstrate that the adult brain is capable of functionally reorganizing45,46 or taking advantage of alternate neural networks.47 Similar strategies have been hypothesized to help persons with more educa- tion compensate for the accumulation of AD patholo- gy.48 In contrast to reducing amyloid deposition or tau phosphorylation, strategies that would allow hu- mans to tolerate the accumulation of disease-related pathology without exhibiting functional impairment could have important implications for the prevention of AD and possibly other common neurodegenerative diseases.

The study has several strengths. The ability to link education to several measures of AD pathology and to multiple cognitive domains assessed proxi- mate to death in a single study offers a unique inte- grative approach to hypothesis testing. All analyses were performed on comparable persons from a single cohort who came to autopsy following high rates of follow-up participation and brain autopsy. This unique cohort provides control for other potentially confounding variables such as occupation and life- style, and the sample size was sufficiently large to control for important demographic variables such as age. Uniform structured procedures were followed with blinding to previously collected data and blind- ing of personnel collecting postmortem data to clini- cal data, further reducing the potential for bias. Finally, confidence in the findings is strengthened by the fact that the correlations with cognition were strongest for neurofibrillary tangles and weakest for diffuse plaques, consistent with the literature.49,50

The study also has limitations. Participants are not representative of the US population as a whole in terms of education and lifestyle. It is possible that these factors could alter the relation of AD pathology to cognitive function. Therefore, the findings will need to be replicated in similar studies of lay persons with a much wider range of educational and lifestyle experiences. The pathologic indices were crude and it will be important to replicate and extend these find- ings using more sensitive and specific immunostains combined with systematic sampling. Finally, the rea- sons underlying the differential findings with respect to plaques and tangles are unclear and will require further study.

### Intro
To test the hypothesis that education level modulates the effects of cerebral white matter hyperin- tensities (WMH) on cognition in a large population-based study. Methods: A total of 845 elderly subjects aged 64 to 76 years who enrolled in a longitudinal study on cognitive decline and vascular aging had an MRI examination. Cognitive functions were assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination, Trail Making Test Part B, Digit Symbol Substitution Test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Revised, Finger Tapping Test, Word Fluency Test, and Raven Progressive Matrix. MRI scans were interpreted visually using a standardized scale for rating WMH. Results: Severe WMH were present in 17% of the participants who had lower performances on tests involving attention tasks. In participants with a lower level of education, presence of severe WMH was significantly associated with lower cognitive performances. This was found for all cognitive tests. Conversely, in participants with a high level of education, there was no significant association between severity of WMH and level of cognitive functions. Conclusion: Education modulates the consequences of WMH on cognition. Participants with a high level of education were protected against the cognitive deterioration related to vascular insults of the brain.
Cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are commonly observed on MRI of the brain of elderly persons. These hyperintensities are usually inter- preted as small brain lesions related to age and vascular risk factors.1

The consequences of WMH on cognition have been investigated in clinical series of demented and non- demented patients and community-based samples.2-17 Most studies have shown a significant association between WMH and cognitive impairment or severity of dementia.2,5-11 However, a majority of these studies are based on small samples3,5,6,9-11,14,15 and none of them has studied the possible role of education on the association between WMH and cognition.

There is substantial evidence of an association between higher educational level and decreased inci- dence of dementia in various populations and study settings.18-20 Different hypotheses have been raised to explain this association, which remains intriguing and regularly debated.21-30 The main hypothesis is that clinical manifestations of cognitive disorders re- lated to brain lesions are delayed in more highly educated people. This putative protective effect of education on the risk of dementia or cognitive im- pairment could also be explored when evaluating the cognitive alterations related to WMH.

In the current study, we examined the relation- ship between WMH and cognitive performances by level of education in a large population-based cohort of elderly individuals.

Study population. The *Epidemiology of Vascular Ageing (EVA) study* is a longitudinal study on vascular aging and cognitive decline. The EVA study sample consists of 1,389 subjects, born between 1922 and 1932, recruited between June 1991 and June 1993 from electoral rolls in Nantes, west of France. The 4-year follow-up (June 1995 through June 1997) was completed by 86% of the initial sample (n = 1,188); 31 subjects died and 170 refused to be re-examined.

At each wave of the study, during a face-to- face interview at the examination center, data on demographic characteristics, medical history, and current medication intake were collected. A complete assessment of cognitive function was performed using a battery of neuropsychological tests designed to cover multiple areas of cognitive functioning.31 The tests were administered by trained psychologists. The Mini-Mental State Ex- amination (MMSE) provided a global assessment of cognitive functioning.32,33 **Attention** was assessed using two tests: the Trail Making Test part B (*TMT B*)34 and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (*DSST*) of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Revised.35 The battery also included assessment of general skills such as logical intelligence and reasoning (Raven Progressive Matrices [RPM]36) and verbal fluency (Word Fluency Test [WFT]37). Assessment of psychomotor speed by the Finger Tapping Test (FTT)38 was also included in this battery.

MRI. At 4-year follow-up, MRI examination was proposed to all subjects and 88% of them agreed to participate. Owing to financial limitations, 845 MRI examinations were performed.

Exclusion criteria were conventional: 1) cardiac pacemaker, valvular prosthesis, or other internal electrical device; 2) history of neurosurgery or aneurysm; 3) metal fragments in the eyes, brain, or spinal cord.

MRI was performed using a 1.0 T scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Details of image acquisition procedure are described elsewhere.39 The proton density and T2-weighted MR images were rated visually with respect to the presence of hyperintensities in the white matter using a modified version of the scale developed by Scheltens et al.40 It provided an overall four-class WMH grade ranging from A to D according to the following criteria: A = no lesion; B (mild WMH) = deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) <=3 mm or periventricular hyperintensities (PH) <=5 mm; C(moderateWMH)= 1 to10 DWMH of 4 to 10 mm or PH of 6 to 10mm; D(severeWMH)=more than 10 DWMH of 4 to 10mm or confluent DWMH or PH >= 11 mm.

All the ratings were done by a single trained doctor who was blind to any clinical data or diagnoses. Among the 845 *MRI* examinations performed, *841 were read* (four scans were not interpreted because of poor technical quality). The intraobserver variability was estimated on a random sample of 100 of the 841 scans. For the four-category grading of WMH, the intrareader kappa coefficient was 0.78.

The distribution of WMH in this sample showed that only 12 subjects had *no WMH (grade A)*. These 12 subjects have therefore been *pooled with* those having *mild* WMH in the analyses.

Covariates. The following covariates were selected on the ba- sis of their known association with cerebral WMH or cognition or both: age, sex, education, occupation, smoking status, alcohol con- sumption, history of vascular disease, hypertension, and depres- sive symptoms. For covariates changing over time—i.e., hypertension, depressive symptoms, smoking status, and alcohol use—values measured at the 4-year time point were studied.

Educational level was assessed at baseline by recording num- ber of years of schooling. Two educational levels were defined based on median of the distribution for stratified analysis: low educational level (less than 11 years of schooling) or high educa-

## DA. Bennett 2005. Education modifies the association of amyloid but not tangles with cognitive function (2005)
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/11.%20Education%20modifies%20the%20association%20of%20amyloid%20but%20not%20tangles%20with%20cognitive%20function.pdf)
### Intro
The authors quantified amyloid and tau tangles in Religious Orders Study participants. In separate analyses, amyloid and tangles were related to level of cognition. When terms for education’s interaction with amyloid and tangles were added, education dampened the association of amyloid with level of cognition (p =0.02) but not the association of neurofibrillary tangles with level of cognition, suggesting that education is related to factors that reduce the effect of amyloid on cognition. Education and related life experiences may increase the density or efficiency of neural elements subserving cognition and provide a buffer against the development of dementia despite the accumulation of disease pathology, a concept referred to as cognitive (neural) reserve. If true, one would expect the relationship between the amount of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and level of cognitive function would differ by years of education. Using crude counts of AD pathology from the maximally involved area from four 6-𝞵m sections stained with modified Bielschowsky silver stains, we previously reported that education modified the relation of senile高龄的 plaques but not neurofibrillary tangles to level of cognition. As silver staining is neither as sensitive as immunohistochemistry nor protein specific and crude counts are more error-prone than random sampling, both factors could have contributed to our inability to find a modifying effect of education with tangles. This study *extends our previous report* by testing the same hypothesis with less biased measures of amyloid load and tau positive neurofibrillary tangles *from multiple brain regions*.

Subjects were participants in the *Religious Orders Study* who agreed to annual clinical evaluation and brain donation. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. More than 1,000 persons have enrolled and completed a uniform structured clinical evaluation. Participation in the annual follow-up evaluations exceeds 95% of survivors, and the autopsy rate exceeds 90%. These analyses are on *156 participants*: 58 without cognitive impairment, 32 with mild cognitive impairment, and 66 with probable AD (table 1). The primary outcome measure was a composite measure of global cognition computed by converting raw scores on *19 cognitive tests to z scores* and *averaging* the z scores to yield the *composite measure*. Further information about the clinical evaluation, individual tests, and derivation of the composite measures is published elsewhere.

At least two *tissue blocks* from the entorhinal cortex and CA1/ subiculum and midfrontal, inferior temporal, inferior parietal, and primary visual cortices were dissected from 1-cm coronal slabs fixed for 48 to 72 hours in 4% paraformaldehyde, *embedded in paraffin*, and cut into 20-𝞵m sections. Amyloid-𝛽 was labeled with MO0872 (1:100; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), which identifies both the 1-40 and 1-42 length fragments. Paired helical filament tau was labeled with AT8 (1:800 in 4% horse serum; Innogenex, San Ramon, CA), an antibody specific for phosphorylated tau. Sections were run with controls on a *robotic immunohistochemical stainer*. Images of amyloid-𝛽-stained sections were captured for *quantitative analysis* using a *systematic random sampling* scheme, and calculation of the percent area occupied by amyloid-𝛽- immunoreactive pixels was performed using the public domain Object-Image 1.62p15. Quantification of tangle density per square millimeter was performed with a stereologic mapping station. In brief, the *software* program *randomly placed a grid* over the region, and a motorized stage stopped at each grid intersection point for sampling (magnification 400x). All objects within the counting frame that did not touch the exclusion lines were counted. Composite summary measures of the percentage area occupied by amyloid-𝛽 and the density of neurofibrillary tangles were made by averaging the values for each lesion for all regions assessed. Details of the dissection, staining, and quantitative immunohistochemistry have been previously reported.从 4% 多聚甲醛中固定 48 至 72 小时并包埋在石蜡中的 1 cm 冠状平板上切下至少两个来自内嗅皮层和 CA1/下托以及中额叶、下颞叶、下顶叶和初级视觉皮质的组织块，以及 切成20-𝞵米的段。 淀粉样蛋白-𝛽 标记有 MO0872（1:100；Dako，Carpinteria，CA），它识别 1-40 和 1-42 长度的片段。 成对的螺旋丝 tau 标记有 AT8（1:800，4% 马血清；Innogenex，San Ramon，CA），一种磷酸化 tau 特异性抗体。 切片在机器人免疫组织化学染色机上进行对照。 使用系统随机抽样方案捕获淀粉样蛋白-𝛽-染色切片的图像用于定量分析，并使用公共领域对象图像 1.62p15 计算淀粉样蛋白-𝛽- 免疫反应像素占据的百分比面积。 每平方毫米缠结密度的量化是用立体映射站进行的。 简而言之，软件程序在该区域上随机放置一个网格，一个电动载物台停在每个网格交叉点进行采样（放大 400 倍）。 所有未触及排除线的计数框内的对象都被计数。 淀粉样蛋白-𝛽 占据的百分比面积和神经原纤维缠结密度的综合汇总测量是通过对所有评估区域的每个病变的值取平均值来进行的。 先前已经报道了解剖、染色和定量免疫组织化学的详细信息。 5

*Multiple linear regression* was used to examine global cognition as a function of amyloid load. A subsequent model added a term for the interaction between education and amyloid load to test whether the association between amyloid and level of cognition differed by years of education. Similar analyses were done with tau tangles. All models *controlled for age and sex*. Models were validated graphically and analytically, and analyses were carried out using SAS/STAT software version 8 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) on a SunUltraSparc workstation (Sun, Palo Alto, CA).

We first examined global cognition as a function of education and amyloid load. Each year of education was associated with a 0.10-unit higher cognitive score, and each percentage increase in amyloid load was associated with a 0.16-unit lower cognitive score (table 2, Model 1a). When a term for the interaction between education and amyloid was added to the model, each additional year of education reduced the impact of 1%of amyloid on level of cognition by 0.02 standard unit (p = 0.016; see table 2, Model 1b). We conducted a similar series of analyses for tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles. Each neurofibrillary tangle (per mm2) was associated with a 0.06-unit lower cognitive score (see table 2, Model 2a). When a term for the interaction between education and tangles was added to the model, the interaction term was not significant (see table 2, Model 2b). The different effects are illustrated in the figure, which plots the predicted relation between each pathology measure and the global cognitive score for participants with 22 years (90th percentile), 18 years (50th percentile), and 15 years (10th percentile) of education. If education modified the association of pathology to cognition, the lines representing different levels of education should diverge as seen for amyloid (figure, A). The magnitude of the effect for amyloid is such that the difference between 15 and 22 years of education is equivalent to about 2.6 years of age progression (estimate for age = 0.054, SE = 0.011, p < 0.001). By contrast, as education did not modify the association of tangles with cognition, the lines representing different levels of education are approximately parallel for tangles (see figure, B).

### Discussion
Few data are available regarding the effect of education on the relation of AD pathology to cognition. One study of persons with dementia did not find a relation between education and plaques or tangles. Another study reported a relation between early life linguistic ability and the density of neurofibrillary tangles, raising the possibility that variables related to education in early life could directly im- pact the accumulation of AD pathology. We previously reported that education modified the relation of senile plaques but not neurofibrillary tangles as- sessed with silver stains to level of cognition. This study extends our previous report by showing that education dampens the association of amyloid deposition but not tau tangles to level of cognition, providing additional evidence that education not only provides a cognitive advantage such that persons with more years of education perform better on cognitive tests and may require more pathology to reach any given level of cognitive impairment but that education is also associated with factors that somehow reduce the effect of amyloid on cognition.

The mechanism underlying the ability of education to modify the impact of pathology on cognition is unknown. One small study reported that persons without dementia who had significant AD pathology had larger brains and greater density of neurons than persons without pathology.8 This is consistent with the possibility that education or related vari- ables9 are associated with maintaining cognitive (neural) reserve and/or neural plasticity as seen in animal models of environmental enrichment.

The reason why education modifies the relation of amyloid but not tangles to cognition is not clear. One possibility is that education is a marker of reserve capacity. As data suggest that amyloid deposition precedes tangle formation, it is possible that the brain’s reserve withstands the deleterious effects of amyloid accumulation. By contrast, tangle formation is more likely to be associated with or a harbinger of neuron death and to indicate a severity of neurodegeneration overpowering the brain’s reserve capacity.

### Intro
- Objective: To evaluate the cognitive reserve hypothesis by examining whether individuals of greater educational attainment have better cognitive function than individuals with less education in the presence of elevated fibrillar brain amyloid levels.  
- Design, Setting, and Participants: Uptake of carbon 11–labeled Pittsburgh Compound B ([11 C]PiB) was measured for participants assessed between August 15, 2003, and January 8, 2008, at the Washington University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and diagnosed either as nondemented (n=161) or with dementia of the Alzheimer type (n=37). *Multiple regression* was used to determine whether [11 C]*PiB* uptake *interacted* with level of *educational* attainment to predict *cognitive function*.  
- Main Outcome Measures: Scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes, Mini-Mental State Exami  nation, and Short Blessed Test and individual measures from a psychometric battery.  
- Results: Uptake of [11 C]PiB interacted with years ofeducation in predicting scoresonthe Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes(P=.003),the Mini-Mental State Examination (P⬍.001), the Short Blessed Test (P=.03), and a measure ofverbal abstract reasoningandconceptualization (P=.02) such that performance on these measures increased with increasing education for participants with elevated PiBuptake. Education was unrelated to global cognitive functioning scores among those with lower PiB uptake. 
- Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that cognitive reserve influences the association between Alzheimer disease pathological burden and cognition. 
目的:在大脑纤维状淀粉样蛋白水平升高的情况下，通过检查受教育程度高的个体是否比受教育程度低的个体具有更好的认知功能来评价认知储备假说。设计、设置和参与者:2003年8月15日至2008年1月8日，华盛顿大学阿尔茨海默病研究中心对参与者11 -标记的匹兹堡化合物B ([11c]PiB)的摄取进行了评估，并诊断为非痴呆(n=161)或阿尔茨海默型痴呆(n=37)。采用多元回归来确定[11c]PiB摄取是否与教育程度相互作用，以预测认知功能。主要结果测量:临床痴呆评分盒、简易精神状态检查、短祝福测试和心理测量组的个人测量得分。结果:摄取[11 C]PiB与受教育年限相互作用，预测临床痴呆盒(P=.003)、迷你心理状态检查(P⬍.001)、短期祝福测试(P=.03)和语言抽象推理和概念化的测量(P=.02)，因此，高pibuptake的参与者在这些测量中的表现随教育程度的增加而增加。在PiB摄取较低的人群中，教育程度与整体认知功能得分无关。结论:认知储备影响阿尔茨海默病病理负担与认知能力的关系。

THE COGNITIVE RESERVE HYpothesis states that persons with greater cognitive reserve are able to withstand more Alzheimer disease (AD) pathological burden without becoming demented by using cognitive processing approaches or compensatory brain networks. Education is a commonly used proxy of cognitive reserve. Adjusting for level of AD pathological burden determined at autopsy, greater education has been associated with better cognitive function during life.3,4 Education interacts with AD pathological burden such that a greater pathological burden is required to show an effect on cognition among persons with more education. A recent advance in AD research is the development of positron emission tomographic (PET) radio tracers to image fibrillar ␤-amyloid (A␤) pathology in vivo. In individuals diagnosed with mild **dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT)**, those with 15 or more years of education (n=12) were found to have higher uptake of carbon 11– labeled Pittsburgh CompoundB ([11 C]PiB) in the frontal cortex compared with [11 C]PiB levels in 13 individuals with 6 years of education.5 These results suggest that moreA␤ pathological burden was required among highly educated individuals than less educated individuals to manifest mild DAT, supporting the cognitive reserve hypothesis. We used [11 C]PiB imaging to further explore the cognitive reserve hypothesis by testing whether education and level of fibrillar brain A␤ interactively affect cognitive functioning in nondemented participants and those with DAT.  
认知储备假说认为，拥有更大认知储备的人，通过认知处理方法或代偿性脑网络，能够承受更大的阿尔茨海默病(AD)病理性负担，而不至于精神错乱。教育是认知储备的常用代表。根据尸检确定的阿尔茨海默病负担水平，更高的教育水平与生活中更好的认知功能有关。教育与AD的病理负担相互作用，需要更大的病理负担才能对受教育程度更高的人的认知产生影响。AD研究的一个最新进展是开发了正电子发射断层扫描 *(PET)放射示踪剂来成像活体纤维状␤-淀粉样蛋白(␤)病理*。在诊断为轻度阿尔茨海默氏症(DAT)的患者中，研究人员发现，受教育15年或以上(n=12)的人额叶皮层中碳11标记的匹兹堡化合物db ([11c]PiB)的摄取量高于13名受教育6年的人[11c]PiB的水平。这些结果表明，与受教育程度较低的个体相比，受教育程度较高的个体需要更多的a␤病理负担才能表现出轻度DAT，支持认知储备假说。我们使用[11 C]PiB成像进一步探索认知储备假说，通过测试教育程度和纤维状脑A␤是否交互影响非痴呆参与者和DAT患者的认知功能。

Data were obtained from participants in longitudinal studies conducted by the Washington University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. Participants completing clinical and cognitive assessments and determined to either be nondemented or have DAT who also completed a PET scan to determine [11 C]PiB uptake were included.  Details regarding recruitment, enrollment, and clinical assessment in these studies were published previously.6 Briefly, experienced clinicians conduct a semistructured interview of the participant and a knowledgeable collateral source as well as a general physical and neurologic examination of the participant. **Scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Short Blessed Test (SBT)**, 2 objective measures commonly used to globally assess and rate dementia severity, can be derived from the clinical assessment, although the scores are not available to the clinicians. Without reference to cognitive test scores, clinicians assign a **Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score** based on the participant’s cognitive ability to function in each of 6 individually scored domains (or boxes): memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Absence of dementia is indicated by a CDR score of 0. A *CDR score of 0.5 or higher indicates* that the clinician believes the participant’s *cognitive abilities have declined relative to his or her previous* levels of performance (ie, the *participant serves as his or her own control*). Very mild, mild, moderate, and severe dementias are represented by CDR scores of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The CDR sum of boxes (CDR-SB) score is obtained by summing the scores from the individual domains. For this study, ==CDR-SB, MMSE, and SBT are== considered measures of ==global cognitive function==. For participants with a CDR score of 0.5 or greater, a clinical diagnosis is assigned in accordance with standard criteria. Our clinical diagnostic criteria for DAT have been validated with 93% accuracy for histopathological AD, including individuals diagnosed with DAT at the CDR score of 0.5 who elsewhere may be considered to represent mild cognitive impairment. Within a few weeks of the clinical assessment, **psychometricians administer** to all participants a **1.5-hour psychometric battery** without knowledge of the CDR score or clinical diagnosis. The battery includes tests measuring specific types of cognitive processes: *animal naming, Trailmaking A and B tests, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, and the similarities subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III)*. 
数据来自华盛顿大学阿尔茨海默病研究中心进行的纵向研究的参与者。受试者完成了临床和认知评估，并被确定为非痴呆或患有DAT，同时完成PET扫描以确定PiB摄取[11 C]。==关于这些研究的招募、登记和临床评估的细节已在之前发表==。6简单地说，经验丰富的临床医生会对参与者进行半结构化的访谈和有知识的旁支来源，以及对参与者进行一般性的身体和神经检查。简易精神状态测试7分(MMSE)和短幸福测试8分(SBT)，这两种普遍用于全面评估和评估痴呆严重程度的客观指标，可以从临床评估中得到，但临床医生无法获得这些分数。在不参考认知测试分数的情况下，临床医生根据参与者在6个单独得分领域(或box)的认知能力分配临床痴呆评分(CDR)，这6个领域分别是:记忆、方向、判断和解决问题、社区事务、家庭和爱好以及个人护理。无痴呆的CDR评分为0分。CDR得分0.5或更高表明临床医生认为参与者的认知能力相对于他或她之前的表现水平有所下降(即参与者作为他或她自己的对照)。非常轻、轻度、中度和重度痴呆分别以0.5、1、2和3分表示。CDR- sb (CDR- sb)分数是将各个域的分数相加得到。10在本研究中，CDR-SB、MMSE和SBT被认为是全球认知功能的衡量指标。对于CDR评分为0.5或更高的参与者，根据标准标准进行临床诊断。我们的DAT临床诊断标准对组织病理学AD的准确性已验证为93%，包括CDR评分为0.5的DAT患者，而在其他地方可能被认为是轻度认知障碍。在临床评估的几周内，心理测量师在不知道CDR评分或临床诊断的情况下，对所有参与者进行1.5小时的心理测量。这组测试包括测量特定类型的认知过程的测试:动物命名、制造足迹A和B测试、自由和线索选择性提醒测试，以及韦氏成人智力量表第三版(WAIS-III)的相似子测试。

Each participant’s structural magnetic resonance image is registered to a standard atlas target that minimizes bias due to atrophy. Alignment of PET and magnetic resonance images within a participant is accomplished via use of an in-house crossmodal registration algorithm, and ANALYZE software (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota) is used to create 3-dimensional ROIs for each participant based on his or her individual magnetic resonance image.18 The ROIs are applied to unblurred images of the PET dynamic data, yielding high-resolution regional time-activity curves. Each time-activity curve is analyzed for PiB specific binding using the graphical analysis by Logan et al, taking the cerebellum ROI data as a reference tissue input function. The cerebellum was chosen as the reference region because there is little specific binding of PiB in postmortem samples of cerebellar cortex even among individuals with AD at autopsy. The slope produced by the graphical analysis by Logan and colleagues is equal to the tracer distribution volume in the tissue of interest when compared with the input function. A **binding potential (BP)** for each ROI is calculated using the equation *BP=distribution volume–1* to express the regional binding values in a manner proportional to the number of binding sites. Mean BP values from the prefrontal cortex, gyrus rectus, lateral temporal cortex, and precuneus ROIs are used to calculate a **mean cortical BP (MCBP)** value based on brain regions known to have high PiB uptake among participants with DAT. An MCBP of 0.18 serves as a borderline value, as nearly all individuals with DAT have MCBPs greater than that value and all young healthy individuals have MCBPs less than that value. **Participants were dichotomized into PiB-negative (MCBP>0.18) or PiB-positive (MCBP<0.18) groups**.  
每个参与者的结构磁共振图像被注册到一个标准的图谱目标，以最小化由于萎缩造成的偏差。通过使用内部的交叉模态配准算法，在参与者体内对PET和磁共振图像进行比对，并使用ANALYZE软件(梅奥诊所，罗切斯特，明尼苏达州)根据每个参与者的磁共振图像为其创建三维roi。将roi应用于PET动态数据的未模糊图像，产生高分辨率的区域时间-活动曲线。采用Logan等人的图形分析方法，以小脑ROI数据作为参考组织输入函数，对每条时间-活动曲线进行PiB特异性结合分析。之所以选择小脑作为参考区域，是因为即使是在AD患者的尸体解剖中，PiB在死后的小脑皮层样本中也很少有特异性结合。Logan等人的图形分析得到的斜率等于示踪剂在感兴趣组织中的分布体积，与输入函数相比。利用BP=分布体积- 1公式计算出每个ROI的结合势(BP)，表示区域结合值与结合位点数量成正比。来自于前额叶皮层、直回、外侧颞叶皮层和楔前叶ROIs的平均BP值被用来计算皮层平均BP值(MCBP)，该值是基于已知的DAT参与者PiB摄取高的大脑区域。18 MCBP值为0.18作为边界值，因为几乎所有DAT患者的MCBP值都大于这个值，而所有年轻的健康个体的MCBP值都小于这个值。18名参与者被分为pib阴性组(MCBP⬍0.18)和pib阳性组(MCBP⬎0.18)。

**Multiple linear regression** analysis using PROC REG (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) was used to test for a significant interaction between education and PiB group (PiB positive vs PiB negative) **in predicting test scores**. Better performance is indicated by lower scores for the CDR-SB, SBT, Trailmaking A test, and Trailmaking B test and by higher scores on the MMSE, animal naming, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, and WAIS-III similarities subtest. Education in years, PiB group, and a term representing their interaction were included in all of the models. **The stepwise selection procedure identified variables that improved the model fit** using the default SAS criteria for model entry (P=.10) and exit (P=.15). Candidate variables for stepwise entry included *sex, age group*, the presence of at least 1 apolipoprotein E (*APOE*) ε4 allele (APOE ε4 positive vs APOE ε4 negative), and time between clinical assessment and PiB scan. Age (median, 67.7 years) and time between clinical assessment and PiB scan (median, 0.42 years) were dichotomized using median splits. Preliminary examination of the data suggested a potential interaction between age group and APOE ε4 status for the global tests such that older participants without an APOE ε4 allele did better on the cognitive tests than older participants with an APOE ε4 allele, but test scores were similar for the APOE ε4 groups among younger participants. Therefore, a term representing that interaction was also a candidate for stepwise entry. Because regression diagnostics indicated that the residuals were skewed, **CDR-SB scores were log transformed after adding 0.5 to each value**.  
使用PROC REG (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina)进行多元线性回归分析，以检验教育水平和PiB组(PiB阳性与PiB阴性)在预测测试成绩方面是否存在显著交互作用。在CDR-SB, SBT, trail - making A测试和trail - making B测试中得分较低，在MMSE，动物命名，自由和线索选择性提醒测试和WAIS-III相似度子测试中得分较高。教育年限，PiB组，以及代表他们互动的一个术语都包含在所有模型中。逐步选择过程使用默认的SAS标准识别模型进入(P=.10)和退出(P=.15)的变量，以提高模型的拟合。逐步进入的候选变量包括性别、年龄组、至少存在1个载脂蛋白E ε4等位基因(载脂蛋白E ε4阳性与载脂蛋白E ε4阴性)，以及临床评估和PiB扫描之间的时间。年龄(中位数，67.7岁)和临床评估与PiB扫描之间的时间(中位数，0.42岁)使用中位数分割进行二分类。对数据的初步研究表明，在整体测试中，年龄组和APOE ε4等位基因状态之间可能存在交互作用，例如，没有携带ε4等位基因的老年人在认知测试中的表现优于携带ε4等位基因的老年人，但在年轻参与者中，携带ε4等位基因的老年人的测试得分相似。因此，表示交互作用的术语也是逐步进入的候选者。由于回归诊断显示残差偏倚，CDR-SB评分在每个值加0.5后进行对数转换。

For tests showing a significant education × PiB interaction, least square mean scores and 95% confidence intervals for PiB-positive and PiB-negative participants within 3 education categories were calculated to illustrate the form of the interaction. For cognitive tests where the interaction term was not significant, the regression analysis was repeated including the main effects of PiB and education but not their interaction. To determine whether the results were specific to the cutoff used to divide participants into groups with high and low A␤ uptake, the **final regression models** were repeated **treating PiB uptake as a continuous variable** by substituting **MCBP** for PiB group. Fisher exact test was used to determine whether the PiB groups differed with regard to a clinical history of vascular risk factors (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke). 
对于显示具有显著教育程度 PiB交互作用的测试，计算了3个教育类别内PiB阳性和PiB阴性参与者的最小二乘法平均分数和95%置信区间，以说明交互作用的形式。对于交互项不显著的认知测试，重复进行回归分析，包括PiB和教育的主要影响，但不包括它们的交互作用。为了确定结果是否与用于将参与者划分为高A和低A$\beta$摄取组的截断值有关，通过用MCBP代替PiB组，将PiB摄取作为连续变量进行最终回归模型的重复处理。采用Fisher精确检验来确定PiB组在血管危险因素(心脏病、高血压、糖尿病和中风)的临床史上是否存在差异。

One hundred ninety-eight participants, including 161 who were nondemented and 37 with DAT (26 with a CDR score of 0.5, 9 with a CDR score of 1, and 2 with a CDR score of2), met inclusion criteria (Table1and Table2). *No significant differences between the PiB-positive and PiB-negative groups were found for history of heart disease (P=.31), hypertension (P=.15), diabetes (P=.31), or stroke (P=.06)*. The ==PiB status== *interacted* significantly with years of *education* in predicting scores on the *global tests and the WAIS-III similarities subtest* (**Table 3**). As illustrated in the **Figure**, *no significant differences* between the *education* groups were found for the *CDR-SB, MMSE, and SBT scores* among participants who were *PiB negative*, but better global functioning scores were associated with more education among those with elevated PiB uptake. Onthe WAIS-III similarities subtest, scores increased with increasing education for participants with and without PiB elevation, but significant differences between the PiB groups were found only for participants in the 2 lower education groups. The PiB status and education did not interact to predict scores on animal naming (P=.45), the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (free recall subtest, P=.50; total, P=.35), the Trailmaking A test (P=.71), or the Trailmaking B test (P=.19). After repeating the analyses without the interaction term, better cognitive functioning on all of the tests was significantly associated with PiB negative status and was associated with more years of education for animal naming, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test free recall subtest, and the Trailmaking B test (Table 3). Similar results were found when PiB uptake was treated as a continuous variable, with significant interactions between education and MCBP found for the global tests (CDR-SB, P=.004; MMSE, P<.001; and SBT, P=.01) and the WAIS-III similarities subtest (P=.04).  
共有198名参与者符合纳入标准，其中161名为精神正常，37名为DAT (CDR评分0.5的26名，CDR评分1的9名，CDR评分2的2名)(表1和表2)。pib阳性组和pib阴性组在心脏病史(P=.31)、高血压(P=.15)、糖尿病(P=.31)和中风(P=.06)方面没有显著差异。PiB状态与教育年限在预测整体测试分数和WAIS-III相似子测试分数上有显著交互作用(表3)。如图所示，在PiB阴性的参与者中，CDR-SB、MMSE和SBT分数在教育组之间没有显著差异，但在PiB摄取升高的参与者中，更好的整体功能分数与更多的教育有关。在WAIS-III相似性子测试中，PiB升高和未升高的参与者的分数随教育程度的增加而增加，但PiB组之间的显著差异仅在2个较低教育程度的参与者中被发现。PiB状态和教育程度在预测动物命名(P=.45)、自由和线索选择性提醒测试(自由回忆子测试，P=.50;总，P=.35)、先行A试验(P=.71)或先行B试验(P=.19)。在重复没有交互项的分析后，所有测试中较好的认知功能与PiB阴性状态显著相关，并与更多的动物命名、自由和线索选择性提醒测试、自由回忆子测试和牵引B测试相关(表3)。当将PiB摄取作为一个连续变量时，也发现了类似的结果，在整体测试中，教育和mcbp之间存在显著交互作用(CDR-SB、p =.004;Mmse, p⬍.001;和SBT, P=.01)和WAIS-III相似性子测验(P=.04)。

These results provide support for the cognitive reserve hypothesis. On each of 3 measures of global cognitive functioning, education interacted with PiB status to predict cognitive function such that persons with greater education maintain better global cognitive functioning in the presence of A␤ pathology. In both *nondemented individuals* and those with **dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT)**, the *interaction* between education and A␤ pathology takes the form of a *floor effect* such that differences between individuals with and without A␤ pathology increase with increasing years of education.
	The floor effect is a phenomenon that occurs in research when a *measurement* instrument or test is *not sensitive enough to detect differences* between individuals or groups who have very low scores on the measure. In other words, the scores of the individuals or groups are so low that they cluster at the lowest possible score or "floor" of the measure, making it difficult to differentiate between them.
Based on autopsy data, *there maybe a ceiling effect* when extensive A␤ pathological burden is present as in late-stage DAT. Presumably, as the AD pathological burden increases, a greater proportion of highly educated participants reaches the threshold for dementia and the initial *advantage provided by cognitive reserve decreases*. Longitudinal imaging of A␤ pathology in vivo will soon allow us to determine whether these inferences from cross-sectional studies are accurate. 这些结果为认知储备假说提供了支持。在全球认知功能的三种测量方法中，教育程度与PiB状态相互作用来预测认知功能，这样，在A␤病理状态下，受教育程度更高的人保持更好的全球认知功能。在未痴呆的个体和患有DAT的个体中，教育和A␤病理之间的交互作用以一种底层效应的形式出现，这样，有和没有A␤病理的个体之间的差异随着教育年限的增加而增加根据尸检数据，当广泛的a␤病理负担出现在dat晚期时，可能存在一个上限效应。4推测，随着AD病理负担的增加，更大比例的受过高等教育的参与者达到痴呆的阈值，认知储备提供的最初优势减少。活体A␤病理的纵向成像将很快允许我们确定这些横断面研究的推论是否准确。

Correlations between educational attainment and scores on global cognitive functioning tests such as the MMSE may indicate test bias. We found *no difference* in global test scores between the education groups among participants who were *PiB negative* but did find differences among those who were PiB positive, suggesting that some education-based differences in scores on global cognitive tests may reflect cognitive reserve differences that mitigate the presence of A␤ pathology. 

Education interacted with A␤ uptake to predict scores on the WAIS-III similarities subtest, a measure of verbal abstract reasoning and conceptualization, but not on tests assessing category fluency, controlled word list learning and verbal/visual memory, attention, visual searching, and mental processing speed. Abstract reasoning may be one of the first types of cognitive processes to be affected in early DAT. Among multiple neuropsychologi cal tests, performances on tests ofabstract reasoning along with memory were found to best differentiate individuals with mild DAT from those with normal cognition.26 Performance on the abstract reasoning task used here has also been found to be strongly related to education.27 Cognitive reserve, as reflected in education, may have a stronger or earlier effect on specific cognitive processes compared with other cognitive processes. However, greater  A␤ deposition was related to worse performance on all of the tests examined here, either as part of an interaction effect or by itself. 教育与A␤吸收相互作用，以预测WAIS-III相似性子测试的得分，这是一种语言抽象推理和概念化的测量，但不包括评估类别流畅性、控制单词列表学习和语言/视觉记忆、注意力、视觉搜索和心理处理速度的测试。抽象推理可能是早期DAT中第一类受影响的认知过程。在多项神经心理学测试中，抽象推理和记忆测试的表现被发现是区分轻度DAT患者和正常认知者的最佳方法在抽象推理任务上的表现也被发现与教育有很大的关系与其他认知过程相比，认知储备在教育中的作用可能更强或更早。然而，更大的A␤沉积与本文所研究的所有测试中更差的性能有关，无论是作为交互作用的一部分，还是其本身。

This study has several strengths, including a large sample comprising both demented and nondemented individuals and multiple measures of cognitive function. There also are limitations, including the high mean educational level of the sample. We also conducted multiple statistical tests, so some statistically significant differences reported here may be due to chance. Nonetheless, the findings extend the examination of the cognitive reserve hypothesis by indicating that persons who are PiB positive and have the highest education are clinically rated as less impaired and perform better on cognitive tests than PiB-positive individuals with less education. 这项研究有几个优势，包括一个大样本，包括痴呆和非痴呆的个人和多种认知功能的测量。也有局限性，包括样本的高平均教育水平。我们还进行了多次统计检验，所以这里报告的一些统计显著差异可能是偶然的。尽管如此，研究结果扩展了对认知储备假说的检验，表明PiB阳性和受教育程度最高的人在临床上被认为比受教育程度较低的PiB阳性的人受损更少，在认知测试中表现更好。

### Discussion
These results provide support for the cognitive reserve hypothesis. On each of 3 measures of global cognitive functioning, education interacted with PiB status to predict cognitive function such that persons with greater education maintain better global cognitive functioning in the presence of A𝛽 pathology. In both nondemented individuals and those with DAT, the interaction between education and A𝛽  pathology takes the form of a floor effect such that differences between individuals with and without A𝛽  pathology increase with increasing years of education.3 Based on autopsy data, there may be a ceiling effect when extensive A𝛽  pathological burden is present as in late-stage DAT.4 Presumably, as the AD pathological burden increases, a greater proportion of highly educated participants reaches the threshold for dementia and the initial advantage provided by cognitive reserve decreases. Longitudinal imaging of A𝛽  pathology in vivo will soon allow us to determine whether these inferences from cross-sectional studies are accurate.

Correlations between educational attainment and scores on global cognitive functioning tests such as the MMSE may indicate test bias. We found no difference in global test scores between the education groups among participants who were PiB negative but did find differences among those who were PiB positive, suggesting that some education-based differences in scores on global cog- nitive tests may reflect cognitive reserve differences that mitigate the presence of A𝛽  pathology.

Education interacted with A𝛽  uptake to predict scores on the WAIS-III similarities subtest, a measure of verbal abstract reasoning and conceptualization, but not on tests assessing category fluency, controlled word list learn- ing and verbal/visual memory, attention, visual searching, and mental processing speed. Abstract reasoning may be one of the first types of cognitive processes to be affected in early DAT. Among multiple neuropsychological tests, performances on tests of abstract reasoning along with memory were found to best differentiate individuals with mild DAT from those with normal cognition.26 Performance on the abstract reasoning task used here has

also been found to be strongly related to education.27 Cognitive reserve, as reflected in education, may have a stronger or earlier effect on specific cognitive processes com- pared with other cognitive processes. However, greater A𝛽  deposition was related to worse performance on all of the tests examined here, either as part of an interac- tion effect or by itself.

This study has several strengths, including a large sample comprising both demented and nondemented in- dividuals and multiple measures of cognitive function. There also are limitations, including the high mean edu- cational level of the sample. We also conducted multiple statistical tests, so some statistically significant differences reported here may be due to chance. Nonetheless, the findings extend the examination of the cognitive re- serve hypothesis by indicating that persons who are PiB positive and have the highest education are clinically rated as less impaired and perform better on cognitive tests than PiB-positive individuals with less education

### Intro
Functional imaging and neuropathological studies suggest that individuals with higher education have better cognitive performance at the same level of brain pathology than less educated subjects. No in vivo studies are available that directly test how education modifies the effect of structural pathology on cognition in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The present study therefore aimed to measure this effect using data from a large multi-center study. *270 patients with AD* underwent cognitive testing using the Mini Mental State Examination (*MMSE*), apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. A linear regression analysis was used to examine the relation of *medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA)*, as a proxy of AD pathology, to MMSE score, *adjusting for age, gender, APOE, cerebrovascular disease, ethnicity, education, and disease duration*. An interaction term for MTA and education was introduced to test the hypothesis that education modifies the effect of MTA on cognition. There was a significant inverse association between MTA and cognition. Most interestingly, the interaction term between education and MTA was significant suggesting that education modifies the relation of MTA to cognition. At any level of pathology, cognition remained higher for better educated individuals.

The medial temporal lobe, which includes the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus (the latter includes the entorhinal cortex), is preferentially affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, including neurofibrillary tangle formation [1], amyloid-β deposition [2], neuronal loss, and volume reduction [3]. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings show some heterogeneity regarding their neuropathological basis [4], MRI medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) is a sensitive marker for pathologic AD stage [5]; MRI is able to detect MTA at early clinical stages of AD [6] and track its progression as the disease advances [7]. Furthermore, MTA is associated with cognitive impairment and decline over time and predicts AD in individuals with minor cognitive impairment [8]. The relationship between AD pathology and clinical symptoms, however, is not tight [9]. Elderly individuals may show a sufficient number of amyloid-β containing plaques and neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy to warrant a neuropathological diagnosis of AD but exhibit no symptoms of dementia during life [10]. The disjunction between pathology and symptoms is thought to indicate a variable capacity among individuals to withstand pathological change, which is referred to as brain reserve [11] or cognitive reserve (CR) [12,13]. Studies relating plaque counts at postmortem examination [14], regional blood flow [15-17], or metabolism [18-25] to clinical symptoms and biographical variables have consistently demonstrated that patients with higher pre-morbid intelligence, longer education, or greater occupational attainment have better cognitive performance at the same level of disease severity. Koepsell and colleagues [26], however, found no evidence of larger education-related differences in cognitive function in patients with more advanced AD neuropathology. The neurobiological substrate of CR is not known but may involve structural factors such as brain size, neuron numbers, and synaptic density as well as functional components including efficiency of neural networks and brain connectivity [27]. Only one study has explored the association between in vivo structural indices of AD pathology, education, and cognition so far. Kidron et al. [28] reported that education was a significant predictor of parietal atrophy, controlling for cognitive impairment, disease duration, age, and sex. There are, however, no other published reports that directly test whether educational attainment modifies the relationship between structural indices of AD pathology, such as MRI-based assessments of brain atrophy, and clinical symptoms. If such an effect were present, it would suggest that the influence of CR is powerful enough to offset significant amounts of brain tissue loss. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that education modifies the association between MTA and cognitive performance in AD, taking into account other variables that are known to impact on cognitive ability, including age [29], apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype [30], head size [31], cerebrovascular lesion burden [32], and duration of disease [33].

The MIRAGE Study was designed as a family-based multi-center study of genetic and environmental risk factors for AD, the details of which, regarding data collection and reliabilities of questionnaires, are published elsewhere [34-36]. Briefly, participants included in this investigation were ascertained through research registries or specialized memory clinics at 17 sites in the USA (14), Canada (1), Germany (1), and Greece (1) between February 2002 and November 2006. All individuals were diagnosed with probable AD according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communication Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria [37]. Medical history, risk factor information, blood samples for genetic analyses, and cranial MRI scans were collected from all study participants. The patients’ *educational* level was *dichotomized* according to the highest level attained (*low education: less than high school graduate; high education: high school graduate or higher*), because the MIRAGE Study assesses levels of educational attainment which are not interval-scaled. A combination of informed written consent by patient and informed consent by proxy was obtained. Procedures involving experiments on human subjects were done in accord with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. Cognitive ability was assessed in all patients using the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) [38]. For the present study only patients with an MMSE score lower than 26 were used to ensure diagnostic accuracy [39]. No other exclusion criteria were applied.

The MRI scanning procedures and analysis protocols have been described previously [40]. In brief, double spin echo, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and high resolution T1 images were acquired from each individual according to exactly the same protocol. All MRI were acquired on 1.5 T scanners and the sequences were modified to suit differences in machine manufacturers and operating systems. Qualitative rating scales were applied, which, by their simplicity, are relatively insensitive to measures at multiple sites [41]. In addition, all data were analyzed by a single rater (C.D.), who was blind to all clinical and genetic data, to reduce interrater variance [42]. The amount of *MTA* was determined from the high resolution T1 scans using a semi-quantitative visual scale [43], ranging from *0 (no atrophy) to 4 (most severe atrophy)* that discriminates well between individuals with AD and cognitively healthy subjects, and has a high degree of inter-rater reliability [44]. Wahlung and colleagues [45] furthermore reported a high correlation between the visual rating and time-consuming volumetric procedures, and the visual rating had a higher diagnostic accuracy in the differentiation between patients with AD and healthy control subjects than the volumetric assessment. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) were rated from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images on a 100 mm visual analogue scale, on which 0 stood for the total absence of WMH and 100 for the most severe degree of WMH. Examples of quantified abnormalities were incorporated as landmarks in the rating process. Finally, the presence or absence of MRI infarction (INF) was determined from the size, location, and imaging characteristics of the lesion, using information from all available scans according to a previously described standard protocol [46]. An overall rating of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) was created using a combination of WMH and INF data to describe the additive effects of both lesion types. CVD stands for the summed severity of WMH and INF; e.g., in the absence of INF, CVD equals WMH severity, whereas in the presence of accompanying INF, the CVD rating is obtained by summing the single scores for WMH and INF. Previous work found that MRI ratings of WMH and INF are associated with cerebrovascular abnormalities but not with AD pathology [4]. Wu et al. [47] reported a high correlation between the semi-quantitative visual rating and an automated quantitative rating on segmented brains.

APOE genotyping was performed using a standard polymerase chain reaction as reported elsewhere [48]. For the purpose of the present study, subjects were classified as APOE ε4 (−) or ε4 (+).

Head circumference was measured in a standardized manner by placing a measuring tape over the eyebrows and passing it around the head to fit snugly over the most posterior protuberance of the occiput [49].

Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), v16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All p-values shown are two-sided and subject to a significance level of 0.05. Correlations (Pearson product-moment or Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients) were calculated in order to explore dependencies in the dataset. More precisely, correlations were computed between the MMSE score and the MTA rating, education, and the CVD rating; and between age and the MTA, and the CVD ratings. The association of MTA and cognitive function was examined using multiple linear regression analysis with the MMSE score as the dependent variable. MTA score and other variables with a putative effect on cognitive function including age, education, gender, head circumference, APOE genotype, CVD rating, and duration of disease were considered as predictors. The regression model also included a trichotomous classification variable for ethnicity (Caucasian, African-American, and Asian- American) with Caucasian as the referent to control for ethnic differences in educational attainment. To control for differences in scanner sensitivity for WMH at the different study centers, variables for the main effect of study center and the interaction between center and WMH were also included in the regression analysis. To determine whether education modified the effect of MTA on cognitive ability, an interaction term between education and MTA was added to the regression model. In this test of effect modification, the interaction term directly examines the extent to which education changes the effect of MTA on cognition. Thus, the interaction term is the primary focus of the analysis. In addition, to compare the distribution of the variable MMSE score with the normal distribution, a normal P-P plot of regression standardized residuals was generated, which compares the cumulative proportions of standardized residuals of the MMSE score with the cumulative proportions of the respective normal distribution. If the normality assumption is not violated, points are clustered around a straight line.

A description of the study sample is given in Table 1. A total of 270 patients with AD were included who had an average age of 75 years, a mean MMSE score of 17 (median 19, range 0–25, kurtosis 0.28, skewness 0.89), and a mean MTA rating of 2.5 (median 3, range 0–4, kurtosis 0.80, skewness 0.42). Approximately 60% of the subjects were female, APOE ε4 allele carriers, and high school graduates. Correlation analysis revealed some plausible significant associations. In particular, a higher MMSE score was associated with a less severe MTA (r = −0.31, p < 0.001), and older age was correlated with both higher MTA (r = 0.35, p < 0.001) and CVD (r = 0.36, p < 0.001) ratings. There was no significant correlation between disease severity as indicated by the MMSE score as well as the MTA rating, education, and the CVD rating (MMSE: r = 0.08, p = 0.43; MTA: r = 0.09, p = 0.16; CVD: r = 0.02, p = 0.76).

In the linear regression analysis, MTA (p < 0.001) and age (p = 0.03) were inversely associated with cognitive performance (indicated by a negative β) (Table 2). The other independent variables were not significant (gender: p = 0.47; APOE genotype: p = 0.92; head circumference: p = 0.74; CVD: p = 0.78; education: p = 0.35; Asian-American ethnicity: p = 0.15; African- American ethnicity: p = 0.07; duration of disease: p = 0.07; study center: p = 0.36, study center * WMH: 0.52).

Most interestingly, in the model with an added interaction term between MTA and education, the interaction term showed a statistically significant inverse association with the MMSE score (p = 0.03), indicating that **education attenuated the impact of MTA on cognitive performance** (again, indicated by a negative β). In this model, age (p = 0.02) and education (p = 0.02) were significant predictors of cognitive performance (Table 2). MTA and the other independent variables did not show significant effects (MTA: p = 0.18; gender p = 0.42; APOE genotype: p = 0.90; head circumference: p = 0.67; CVD: p = 0.62; Asian-American ethnicity: p = 0.11, African-American ethnicity: p = 0.09; duration of disease: p = 0.09; study center: p = 0.48, study center * WMH: 0.43). The normal P-P plot of regression standardized residuals supported the normality assumption (Fig. 1).

The present study suggests that educational attainment modifies the association between ratings of MTA and cognitive performance in patients with AD, taking into account other factors which may have an impact on cognition, including age, gender, APOE genotype, head size, and cerebrovascular lesion burden. *In well-educated patients, the effect of MTA on cognition was weaker than in less-educated subjects*. This finding is consistent with the concept of CR [12, 13]. It is also in line with previous studies relating functional and structural indicators of neurodegeneration, including metabolism, cerebral blood flow or brain atrophy, with cognitive ability and education as a measure of CR. These studies have consistently demonstrated that the association between in vivo pathological indices and cognitive impairment was weaker in better educated individuals with AD [15,16,18,21,28], dementia with Lewy bodies [22], frontotemporal dementia [50], and non-fluent progressive aphasia [20]. In addition, clinico- pathological studies have suggested that not only functional alterations but also morphological brain changes have a less negative effect on cognitive ability shortly before death in patients with greater CR [51]. In line with these studies, our findings suggest that the effect of CR, whatever its nature, is robust enough to offset the consequences of brain tissue loss on cognitive ability.

Some limitations of the study should be considered in the interpretation of the results. First, our patient sample was generally well-educated and was recruited from memory clinics or similar institutions, so that the results may not be generalizable. This may be one of the reasons for the underrepresentation of CVD in the study sample. Particularly, cerebral infarction was rather rare, so that the CVD rating predominantly represents WMH. Therefore, effects of CVD on cognition may have been underestimated. Second, *MTA was assessed using a visual rating procedure which may not be sensitive* to minor or non-linear changes. Therefore, the analysis might be improved by volumetric MTA measurements. Third, we considered education level as a dichotomous outcome and may not have captured non-linear effects of years of schooling or identified a level of education that is optimal for assessing the effect of education on the association of MTA with cognitive performance. Furthermore, it has to be noted that education might not be the ideal proxy for CR, although it has been used as such in most studies. Other demographic factors, such as intelligence [18], lifetime occupation [17], leisure activities [15], or social networks [52] may also contribute to CR in a way that is yet to be understood. Forth, the MMSE was used to rate cognitive impairment in the MIRAGE study. Although it is a reliable assessment scale in AD, more sensitive tests may have further improved the results.

In conclusion, the present study strengthens the concept of CR by demonstrating that manifest morphological brain changes have a less negative effect on cognition in patients with AD and greater educational attainment. Therefore, education is not only associated with a cognitive advantage such that well-educated individuals have better cognitive function and require more pathology to reach any given level of cognitive impairment; education also modifies the association between pathology and cognition at any given level of brain damage. Future studies using more precise volumetric measures of MTA in a larger sample are needed to refine and extend the results of the present study.

[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/2.%20Cognition%20and%20beta-amyloid%20in%20preclinical%20Alzheimer’s%20disease-%20Data%20from%20the%20AIBL%20study.pdf)
### Intro
The ‘preclinical’ phase of Alzheimer’s disease is a future target for treatment, but additional research is essential to understand the relationship between ␤-amyloid burden and cognition during this time. We investigated this relationship using a large sample of *apparently healthy older adults* (N = 177), which also enabled examination of whether the relationship differed according to age, gender, years of education, apolipoprotein E status, and the presence of subjective memory complaints. In addition to episodic memory, a range of cognitive measures (global cognition, semantic memory, visuospatial performance, and executive function) were examined. Participants were aged over 60 years with no objective cognitive impairment and came from the imaging arm of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of ageing. *11C-PiB PET* was used to measure $\beta$-amyloid burden and a *PiB ‘cut-off’* level of 1.5 was used to separate participants with low PiB retention from those with high PiB retention. Thirty-three percent of participants had a PiB positive scan. PiB *positive* participants were 5 years older, twice as likely to carry an apolipoprotein E $\varepsilon$ 4 allele, and their composite episodic *memory was 0.26 SD worse* than PiB negative volunteers. Linear regressions with ␤-amyloid burden as a dichotomous predictor, revealed an *interaction* between ␤-amyloid burden and gender, as well as age and *education effects*, in predicting episodic memory and visuospatial performance. In females, but not in males, increased ␤-amyloid was related to worse episodic memory and visuospatial performance. Furthermore, an interaction between ␤-amyloid burden and APOE status was found in predicting visuospatial performance, whereby there was a trend for increased $\beta$-amyloid to relate to worse visuospatial performance for those without an APOE  $\varepsilon$ 4 allele. There were no other main or interaction effects of $\beta$-amyloid on any of the other composite cognitive measures. These cross-sectional findings suggest that $\beta$-amyloid burden does not have a large effect on cognition in this subset of apparently healthy older people. The finding of gender differences deserves further research to answer definitively the important question of gender susceptibility to adverse cognitive effects from $\beta$-amyloid. 

The participants for this study were the 177 (100 from Melbourne, 77 from Perth) apparently healthy older people (mean age = 72 ± 7, range 60–89) enrolled in the AIBL study, and reported in Rowe et al. (2010). All participants had *no objective evidence of cognitive impairment*, were fluent in English, and had no significant neurological history. Informed written consent was obtained prior to participation. Ethics approval was granted from the Human Research Ethics Committees at Austin Health, St Vincent’s Health, Hollywood Private Hospital, and Edith Cowan University. APOE genotype was determined by direct sequencing, and 43% carried an APOE $\varepsilon$ 4 allele. Fifty percent of the volunteers were male, 54% had subjective *complaints* about their *memory* (established by the question: “do you have difficulties with your memory?”), and 54% had more than 12 years of education. Table 1 displays participant demographics according to PiB status. 

All participants underwent a PiB-PET scan as previously described (Pike et al., 2007; Rowe et al., 2007) at Austin Health Centre for PET, Melbourne or WA PET and Cyclotron service, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth. Each participant received ∼370 MBq 11C-PiB intravenously over 1 min. A 30-min acquisition in 3D mode starting 40 min after injection of PiB was performed with a Phillips AllegroTM PET camera. A transmission scan was performed for attenuation correction. PET images were reconstructed using a 3D RAMLA algorithm. Participants also received a 3D T1-weighed MRI acquisition with MP-RAGE, FLAIR, SWI, and DTI sequences, for screening and subsequent co-registration with the PET images. Co-registration of each individual’s MRI with the PET images was performed in PET native space with MilxView®, developed by the Australian e-Health Research Centre BioMedIA (Brisbane, Australia). A region of interest template was placed on the MR and transferred to the co-registered PET images. *Standardized uptake values (SUV)* were calculated for all brain regions examined. *SUV ratios (SUVR)* were generated by normalising the regional SUV to the cerebellar cortex SUV. Neocortical A␤ burden was expressed as the average SUVR of the area-weighted mean of frontal, superior parietal, lateral temporal, lateral occipital, and anterior and posterior cingulate regions. In accordance with previous studies reporting marked PiB retention in cognitively unimpaired healthy controls (Aizenstein et al., 2008; Mintun et al., 2006; Pike et al., 2007; Rowe et al., 2007), most participants demonstrated low levels of PiB retention, but there was a subset of participants with higher PiB retention. Consequently, to identify a PiB ‘cut-off’ level to separate participants with low versus high PiB retention, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on all elderly apparently healthy participants yielding a mean *cut-off for neocortical SUVR of 1.5*. 

Participants took part in a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, as previously described (Ellis et al., 2009). The following composite measures of cognitive functioning were constructed using z scores in relation to a large normative database (Ellis et al., 2009): global cognition, episodic memory, semantic memory, visuospatial performance, and executive function. *Global* cognition was based on the average of delayed recall on the California Verbal Learning Test—second edition (CVLT-II; Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, & Ober, 2000), copy and delayed recall of the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT; Meyers & Meyers, 1995), delayed recall of the first Logical Memory (LM) story from the WMS (Wechsler, 1945), Stroop incongruent condition (Strauss, Sherman, & Spreen, 2006), category, letter, and switching fluency (Delis, Kaplan, & Kramer, 2001), Boston Naming Test (BNT; Saxton et al., 2000), and Digit Span and Digit Symbol Coding subtests from the WAIS-III (Wechsler, 1997). The composite *episodic memory* score was based on the average of delayed recall on the CVLT-II, RCFT, and first LM story. *Semantic memory* was based on the average of the BNT and category fluency. *Visuospatial* performance was based on RCFT copy. *Executive function* was based on the average of Stroop incongruent condition, category, letter, and switching fluency, and digit span. 

Preliminary analyses examined demographic and cognitive differences between groups (PiB positive; PiB negative) using t tests or chi-square analysis, as appropriate. Pearson’s correlations were used to examine the basic relationship between each cognitive composite score and A$\beta$ burden. To investigate the effect of possible moderating variables (age, gender, years of education, APOE status, and subjective memory complaints), a series of multiple regressions was conducted to examine the relationship between A$\beta$  burden and each of the composite cognitive measures (global cognition, episodic memory, semantic memory, visuospatial performance, and executive function). *Years of education was coded as a dichotomous variable: up to 12 years; greater than 12 years.* To represent the interaction between A$\beta$  burden and each moderator variable, the variables were first centred and then multiplied together. Separate regressions were conducted treating *A$\beta$ burden as a continuous* variable and as a *dichotomous* variable. The overall significance level ($\alpha$) was set to .05. Given the number of predictors, and the primary aim of exploring any relationship between cognition and A burden, if a trend (p < .1) was observed for the effect of A$\beta$ burden or any interactions involving A$\beta$ burden, the regression was re-run with only those predictors with p < .1 in the original regression, plus main effects of A$\beta$ burden and the moderating variable. Finally, any significant A$\beta$ burden interactions were examined using follow-up t-tests. 

Overall, 33% of the apparently healthy older volunteers had a PiB positive scan. As shown in Table 1, there were no differences between PiB positive and PiB negative participants in terms of gender, years of education, or the proportion of memory complainers. PiB positive participants were on average 5 years older, t(175) = 4.77, p < .001, were nearly twice as likely to carry an APOE $\varepsilon$ 4 allele, $\chi^2$ (1, n = 177) = 14.07, p < .001, and performed 0.26 SD  worse on the composite episodic memory measure t(88.7) = 1.93, p = .049 (using a t statistic not assuming homogeneity of variance, as Levene’s test for equality of variances was violated, F (1, 175) = 7.71, p = .006). There were no significant differences between PiB positive and PiB negative participants on MMSE or any of the other cognitive composite scores (Table 1). 

Correlations were performed for each cognitive composite score to determine whether A$\beta$ burden predicts cognitive performance, without accounting for possible moderating factors. These revealed a relatively weak, but significant, relationship between A$\beta$ burden and episodic memory only (R = −.19, p = .012). No relationships were found between A$\beta$ burden and global cognition, semantic memory, executive functions, or visuospatial performance. Next, a range of individual differences (age, gender, years of education, APOE status, and memory complaints) were examined to determine whether they had any influence on the relationship between A$\beta$ burden (as a continuous variable) and cognition. As shown in *Table 2*, there were *main effects of years of education on all cognitive variables*, except semantic memory. Age had a main effect on global composite, episodic memory, and visuospatial performance, and a trend for a main effect on executive functions (p = .057). Memory complaints had a main effect on executive functions only. Gender, APOE status, and A$\beta$ burden did not have main effects for any of the cognitive measures. The primary interest was to identify any main or interaction effects involving A$\beta$ burden, but no significant effects were found for any of the cognitive measures. 

The same regression analyses were repeated, except that established cut-offs for a positive versus negative PiB scan were used to treat A$\beta$ burden as a dichotomous, rather than as a continuous, variable. As shown in *Table 3*, the main effects were unchanged, including no main effect of A$\beta$ burden on any of the cognitive measures. In this case, however, there were some interaction effects involving A$\beta$ burden. For episodic memory, there was a trend for a gender × A$\beta$ burden interaction (p = .062). Given that the main purpose of the study was to examine any effects of A$\beta$ burden on cognition, this trend was further examined by conducting another regression analysis, removing any moderating demographic variables where p was >1. Thus the regression included: A$\beta$ burden, age, education, gender, and gender × A$\beta$, as shown in column EMR in Table 3. In this case, the interaction between gender and A$\beta$ attained significance (p = .040). The interaction is demonstrated in Fig. 1, and follow-up t tests showed that PiB positive females performed 0.5 SD worse on  episodic memory tasks than PiB negative females t(40.72) = 2.89, p = .006 (using a t statistic not assuming homogeneity of variance, as Levene’s test for equality of variances was violated, F (1, 86) = 7.63, p = .007), whereas there were no differences between PiB positive and negative males, t(87) = 0.02, ns. 

For visuospatial function, there was a significant gender × A$\beta$ burden interaction, as well as trends for interactions between *education × A$\beta$ (p = .057)* and APOE × A$\beta$ (p = .065). The trends were further examined by conducting another regression analysis, removing any moderating demographic variables where p was >1. Thus the regression included: A$\beta$ burden, age, education, education × A$\beta$, APOE, APOE × A$\beta$, gender, and gender × A$\beta$, as shown in column VSR in Table 3. In this case, the statistically significant interaction between gender and A$\beta$ remained, and the interaction between APOE and A$\beta$ attained significance (p = .047), although the interaction between education and A$\beta$ remained a trend only (p = .075). The gender interaction is demonstrated in Fig. 2, and follow-up t tests revealed that PiB positive females performed 0.6 SD worse on the visuospatial task than PiB negative females, t(38.3) = 2.15, p = .038 (using a t statistic not assuming homogeneity of variance, as Levene’s test for equality of variances was violated, F (1, 86) = 4.54, p = .036), whereas there was no significant difference between PiB positive and negative males t(87) = 0.96, ns. The APOE interaction is demonstrated in Fig. 3, and follow-up t tests revealed that there was a strong trend within those who did not carry the E4 allele for PiB positive to perform worse than PiB negative,  t(99) = 1.88, p = .063, whereas there were no differences between PiB positive and negative E4 carriers, t(74) = 0.17, ns.

## EM. Lane 2011. Influence of Education on Subcortical Hyperintensities and Global Cognitive Status in Vascular Dementia
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/13.%20Influence%20of%20education%20on%20subcortical%20hyperintensities%20and%20global%20cognitive%20status%20in%20vascular%20dementia.pdf)
### Intro
*Subcortical hyperintensities (SH)* 皮层下高信号 on neuroimaging are a prominent feature of vascular dementia (VaD) and SH severity correlates with cognitive impairment in this population. Previous studies demonstrated that SH burden accounts for a degree of the cognitive burden among VaD patients, although it remains unclear if individual factors such as cognitive reserve influence cognitive status in VaD. To address this issue, we examined *36 individuals* diagnosed with *probable VaD* (age = 77.56; education = 12). All individuals underwent MMSE evaluations and MRI brain scans. We predicted that individuals with higher educational attainment would exhibit less cognitive difficulty despite similar levels of SH volume, compared to individuals with less educational attainment. A regression analysis revealed that greater SH volume was associated with lower scores on the MMSE. Additionally, education moderated the relationship between SH volume and MMSE score, demonstrating that individuals with higher education had higher scores on the MMSE despite similar degrees of SH burden. These results suggest that educational attainment buffers the deleterious effects of SH burden on cognitive status among VaD patients.

Vascular dementia (VaD) refers to cognitive impairment secondary to cerebral vascular disease that is of sufficient severity to impact activities of daily living. VaD is believed by some to represent the second most prevalent type of dementia in the United States after Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Roman, Erkinjuntti, Wallin, Pantoni, & Chui, 2002). The prevalence of VaD has been the subject of debate, particu- larly in terms of the independence of VaD from AD (Di Iorio, Zito, Lupinetti, & Abate, 1999; Jellinger, 2003; Jellinger & Attems, 2003; Wallin, 1998). However, many studies have reported that these diseases are characterized by unique neuropsychological profiles. VaD patients normally have a more intact recognition memory system, and greatly impaired executive functions, compared to AD patients (Graham, Emery, & Hodges, 2004; Kertesz & Clydesdale, 1994; Tierney et al., 2001; Traykov et al., 2005).

The expression of VaD is highly variable and dependent upon lesion size and location. The most commonly affected areas are the subcortical regions of the gray and white matter, likely due to the vulnerability of the small anastamosing vessels that perfuse these regions and are compromised by aging. As noted above, common cognitive deficits associated with subcortical VaD are slowed processing speed, memory impairment, executive dysfunction, and impaired language fluency (Jokinen et al., 2006; Paul, Garrett, & Cohen, 2003), although heterogeneity is the rule as the cognitive profile will depend on the affected underlying neural circuits.

Subcortical hyperintensities (SH), a hallmark feature of subcortical VaD, are believed to represent necrotic or inflamed tissue due to small subcortical strokes visualized as areas of bright white regions on T2 or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI (Fischer et al., 2007). The development of SH appears to be related to both vascular factors, such as hypertension, as well as degenerative factors, such as brain shrinkage, due to aging and disease (Fischer et al., 2007). Other possible causes have been suggested including blood–brain barrier failure and endothelial leakage (Warlaw, Sandercock, Dennis, & Starr, 2003). Several studies have demonstrated that SH in VaD populations are associated with impairment in processing speed and execu- tive function (Bombois et al., 2007; Jokinen et al., 2005). Additionally, areas of SH in healthy, nondemented older individuals have been shown to be related to declines in processing speed (Nebes et al., 2006; Paul et al., 2005; Schmidt et al., 1993).

In other dementia populations such as AD, the level of cognitive impairment associated with neuropathological burden appears to be mitigated by higher levels of educational attainment. This level of discrepancy between neuropatholo- gical features of disease and conserved behavioral competence may be attributed to modifying factors that support brain function despite advanced disease. The concept of cognitive reserve (CR) has been proposed to explain the discrepancy between individuals with similar degrees of pathology, but with varying functional capacities (Stern, 2002). Several stu- dies indicate that this discrepancy may be accounted for by individual life experiences, such as educational attain- ment (McDowell, Xi, Lindsay, & Teirney, 2007; Mortimer, Snowdon, & Markesbery, 2003; Wilson et al., 2009), IQ (Sole-Padulles et al., 2009), linguistic ability (Riley, Snowdon, Desrosiers, & Markesbery, 2005; Snowdon et al., 1996), active social lifestyles (Fratiglioni, Paillard-Borg, & Winblad, 2004), and leisure activities (Helzner, Scarmeas, Cosentino, Portet, & Stern, 2007; Scarmeas & Stern, 2003).

Individual differences in head circumference, brain volume, and synaptic density may account for the impact of CR on behavioral outcomes (Kesler, Adams, Blasey, & Bigler, 2003; Mortimer et al., 2003). Other models suggest that these effects are due to redundancy in the normal brain networks, providing more cognitive strength and flexibility after damage (Helzner et al., 2007; Riley et al., 2005; Scarmeas, Albert, Manly, & Stern, 2006; Stern et al., 2005).

The construct of CR has been most extensively studied in AD (McGurn, Deary, & Starr, 2008; Roselli et al., 2009; Stern, 2006; Wolf, Julin, Gertz, Winblad, & Wahlund, 2004). Other studies have identified evidence for the role of CR in traumatic brain injury (Kesler et al., 2003), Lewy body dementia (Del Ser, Hachinski, Merskey, & Munoz, 1999), and hepatitis C (Bieliauskas et al., 2007). Several studies have examined CR in the context of vascular disease among nondemented individuals. Results from these studies revealed that greater CR variables were associated with better cognitive outcome. A study by Dufouil, Alperovitch, and Tzourio (2003) revealed that individuals with greater education withstood greater vascular insult to the brain. Another study by Nebes et al. (2006) revealed that education provided protection against poor processing speed due to SH in normal aging.

To date, studies have not examined the impact of CR in the context of VaD, yet the issue is important in terms of identifying factors associated with disease status. The current study investigated the relationship between educational attainment, SH volume and global cognitive status in a sample of patients with VaD. The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) is a brief measure of global cognitive function, and is used regularly as a cognitive screening tool by physicians. We hypothesized that individuals with greater educational attainment would perform better on the MMSE than individuals with less education, even if the higher educated individuals have greater amounts of SH damage.

The study consisted of *36 participants* (mean age=*77.56*; SD=5.71; mean education=12.03; SD=3.38, education range=6–20 years; see Table 1) diagnosed with probable VaD. All participants were extracted from a larger cohort of individuals that were originally enrolled in a *longitudinal late phase drug trial to treat VaD*. Results of the trial revealed no significant drug-effects (Cohen, Browndyke, et al., 2003), and therefore, the treatment and placebo groups were collapsed for the present study. The current sample was extracted from the larger cohort based on the presence of complete baseline data.

All participants were diagnosed with probable VaD by consensus and met criteria for both the NINDS-AIREN and DSM-IV criteria. To establish these diagnoses, a thorough neuropsychological and neurological examination was per- formed that included a complete medical history from the patient and an additional informant, and structural neuro- imaging scans. Due to this study being a pharmacological study in origin, rigorous efforts were made to identify indi- viduals with probable pure VaD, rather than probable mixed dementia. To increase the reliability of the diagnoses, all VaD diagnoses were made by group consensus between experts in the field. All participants were between the ages of 67 and 88 years old and had a score below 24 on the MMSE. Exclusionary criteria included terminal systemic illnesses, other neurological disorders, major psychiatric disorders, and contraindications for MRI. Written informed consent was obtained from each of the participants. All aspects of the study protocol were approved by the local IRB, and all research was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.

All subjects underwent an MRI, and they were administered the MMSE as part of a larger neuropsychological battery. Education was used as a proxy measure of cognitive reserve. Education was quantified as a continuous variable using highest level of years of education completed. Previous studies have used education as a proxy measure of CR with robust results (Dufouil et al., 2003; McDowell et al., 2007; Nebes et al., 2006; Roselli et al., 2009).

SH volume was determined by MRI using a 1.5 Tesla Siemens Magnatom Vision scanner within 1 week of neuro- psychological assessment. FLAIR pulse sequences [repeti- tion time (TR) 5 6000 ms; echo time (TE) 5 105 ms] were used to acquire 5-mm-thick axial slices with a 2-mm gap between slices. Field of view was 24 3 24 cm, with a matrix of 192 3 256 voxels. MedVision System software was used to download and reconstruct the neuroimaging data. SH quantification is described in more detail in previous studies (Cohen et al., 2002; Garrett et al., 2004). Briefly, SH volumes were quantified with a semi-automated thresholding routine performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at http:// rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Brain volume and SH volume were calculated using a semi-automatic thresholding techni- que that categorized bandwidths of light as white, black, or gray based on an intensity histogram that was generated for each individual. A threshold for each light peak was set manually to represent brain tissue, SH, and cerebrospinal fluid, and the threshold was then applied across all scan slices to render volume summations. Brain volume was calculated by summing all pixels classified as brain tissue (excluding space) and a ratio of SH was defined as the total SH value in subcortical and periventricular areas over whole brain volume. Calculated SH volumes were expressed as a ratio of total subcortical and periventricular hyperintensity over whole brain volume, excluding ventricular space. Intrarater reliability of the SH quantification exceeded .96.

Moderated multiple regression was used to determine if the relationship between MMSE score and SH volume was dependent on level of education, an indication of CR. Two regressions were estimated, one we will call the ‘‘main effects’’ model and the other the ‘‘interaction’’ model. SH volume and level of education were mean centered before creation of an interaction term to facilitate interpretation and to reduce multicollinearity that would occur for the first order variables with the interaction term (Aiken & West, 1991). For the first model, MMSE was regressed onto the mean centered SH volume and the mean centered education level. The interaction term was then added to the regression as a moderator in a second model to determine if the relationship between SH volume and MMSE scores were dependent on level of education. Results of both models are presented below.

The regression of MMSE onto mean centered SH volume and mean centered education was significant (F(2,33) = 5.77; p < .05) accounting for 26% of the variance in MMSE (see Table 2). Without accounting for the interaction, SH volume had an overall negative relationship with MMSE and educa- tion had an overall positive. However, these effects should only be interpreted with the following model which includes the interaction. The interaction accounted for an additional 13% (R2 = .39) of the variance (F(3,32) = 6.76; p < .05). The effect size is modest at $f^2$ = .21. The most important point to note for this interaction model is the form of the interaction. Figure 1 shows the simple slopes for the rela- tionship between MMSE and SH volume when education is high (defined as the mean11 standard deviation ,15.4 years) and when education is low (defined as the mean – 1 standard deviation , 7.6 years). These values are arbitrary and sample dependent, but this method of illustrating the effects is well-documented and accepted (Aiken & West, 1991; Cohen, Cohen, Aiken, & West, 2003). Figure 1 shows that the overall relationship of SH volume with MMSE scores when education is low is negative. That is, when individuals with lower education experience high SH volume, they are more inclined to experience lower MMSE. On the contrary, when individuals have higher education the relationship between SH volume and MMSE scores is attenuated. The overall pattern expressed in Figure 1 is consistent with a buffering hypothesis (Cohen, Cohen et al., 2003) whereby edu- cation buffers the relationship between SH volume and MMSE.

### Discussion
Our cross-sectional results suggest that education, a proxy measure of CR, provides protection against decline in cognitive function due to SH damage in the brain. To our knowledge, these are the first data that describe a relationship between CR and SH burden in a VaD cohort. Additionally, our results are consistent with previous studies indicating that increased SH volume has a negative outcome on global cognitive function in patients diagnosed with VaD.

The main hypothesis investigating whether the protection of CR extended to a VaD group was supported in this study. On a test of overall cognitive function, individuals with higher educational attainment, a proxy measure of CR, per- formed better than individuals with similar degrees of SH pathology. To the extent that educational attainment serves as a valid proxy for mental activity, our findings indicate that greater amounts of mental activity in young adulthood are beneficial later in life. These effects may provide a buffer against functional decline in the face of damage to the brain. This is important because it provides a means by which an individual can modify their risk factors for dementia. Furthermore, the results may provide information regarding their prognosis following clinical diagnosis.

A few studies have investigated the role of CR in popula- tions with varying degrees of vascular burden. A study by McGurn et al. (2008) reported that individuals who scored higher on an early life test of premorbid ability were less likely to develop VaD later in life. Nebes et al. (2006) reported that white matter lesions in a healthy older popula- tion were related to deficits in processing speed. This rela- tionship was further influenced by education level, but only

in individuals with less than a college level education. Of interest is that the Nebes et al. (2006) study included individuals with greater than 12 years of education. Dufouil et al. (2003) also reported that education moderated the relationship between neuropsychological performance and SH burden among healthy older adults with SH. Our data suggest that the protective effect of education is evident among individuals with a range of educational attainment, and a clinical diagnosis of dementia.

While the exact mechanisms of CR are largely unknown several studies have revealed that greater brain volume and head circumference may provide a buffer, likely by support- ing synaptic complexity (Kesler et al., 2003; Mortimer et al., 2003). However, this passive model, or brain reserve model, does not take into account individual variability in response to damage or compensation, which has led to the introduction of ‘‘active’’ models of reserve (Stern, 2002). These active models postulate that the systems involved in processing a task are more efficient among individuals with greater reserve, perhaps through redundancy, allowing an individual to better cope with damage (Stern, 2006, 2009). Our study provides further support for the active model of reserve. We observed that it may not be simple neuronal or synaptic density that accounts for the differences in cognitive ability, since some individuals with greater education may still have less brain volume. Instead, there appears to be supportive value to the greater amount of education that these individuals have received. While the above discussion is of interest, it is important to note that our study was not designed to determine the mechanisms associated with CR and therefore future work in this area is needed.

It should be noted that in the many VaD cases reviewed at autopsy, the pathology is of mixed origin and often shared with AD pathology. Significant efforts were undertaken in the parent pharmaceutical study to ensure that the sample included individuals with VaD rather than a mixed sample. Nevertheless, a measure of caution is warranted since it is not possible to determine the fidelity of the diagnosis in the absence of autopsy data. Additionally, since we believe this to be a pure VaD group, the current findings would only be applicable to individuals with pure VaD, and it is unknown if these findings can be generalized to a mixed pathology group.

A limitation of the current study is the small sample size used for the regression analyses. It is worth noting that in general, it is difficult to detect interactions in small sample sizes. Thus, given both the form and magnitude of this interaction, the sample size becomes less a concern. It is very unlikely that the effects determined here are spurious (see Evans, 1985). To address concerns about the stability of the results, we used a bootstrapping technique to provide further evidence of the interaction reported in the results (Davison & Hinkley, 1999; Efron & Tibshirani, 1993). By replicating the procedure using random sampling with replacement 999 times, we determined that the effect size of the interaction shows little bias (median $f^2$ = .22; median R2 = .42). Another weakness in the current study is the use of the MMSE as an overall measure of cognitive function. We chose to use the MMSE because it is a highly used test in clinical practice, however it may not be ideal for a VaD sample due to the limited assessment of executive function using this scale. This is important as the executive domain is relatively more impaired than other domains in some forms of VaD (Boyle, Paul, Moser, & Cohen, 2004; Jokinen et al., 2006; Paul et al., 2003). Additionally, our study provides evidence that even with the limitations of the MMSE in a VaD population, the impact of CR on this test is evident and therefore impacts clinical performance. Relatedly, previous studies of healthy adults indicate that assessment of individual cognitive domains rather than global function may provide additional insight into the nature of the relationships between CR and neuropsychological performance (Kaplan et al., 2009).

Finally, previous studies have indicated that the effects of education on the vascular system and cognitive performance are not related to higher socioeconomic status or health advantages in more educated individuals (McDowell et al., 2007). Our study did not investigate whether the influence of education would still be significant when these other factors are taken into account. Future studies should focus on con- trolling the effects of these factors to investigate if the CR hypothesis remains valid in a VaD population.

The findings of this study suggest that individuals with a greater amount of educational attainment are able to cogni- tively withstand greater amounts of damage related to VaD than individuals with comparable damage and less education. There are several implications that can be derived from these findings. First, individuals should be encouraged to engage in mental activity to mitigate the neuropsychological compro- mise associated with vascular pathology. While education was the focus of the current study, education is believed to represent a proxy for focused mental activity. Second, our data may aid clinicians in determining with greater certainty the prognosis of patients diagnosed with VaD based on educational attainment.

[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/20.%20Very%20low%20levels%20of%20education%20and%20cognitive%20reserve-%20a%20clinicopathologic%20study.pdf)
### Intro
We conducted a clinicopathologic study in a large population with very low levels of education to determine whether very few years of education could contribute to cognitive reserve and modify the relation of neuropathologic indices to dementia. In this cross-sectional study, we included 675 individuals 50 years of age or older from the *Brazilian Aging Brain Study Group*. Cognitive abilities were evaluated through a structured interview with an informant at the time of autopsy, including the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. Neuropathologic examinations were performed using immunohistochemistry and fol- lowing internationally accepted criteria. Multivariate linear regression models were conducted to determine whether the association between cognitive abilities (measured by CDR sum of boxes) and years of education was independent of sociodemographic variables and neuropathologic indi- ces, including neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, lacunar infarctions, small-vessel disease, and Lewy bodies. In addition, interaction models were used to examine whether education mod- ified the relation between neuropathologic indices and cognition. Mean education was 3.9 6 3.5 years. Formal education was associated with a lower CDR sum of boxes (b 5 20.197; 95% confidence interval 20.343, 20.052; p 5 0.008), after adjust- ment for sociodemographic variables and neuropathologic indices. Furthermore, education mod- ified the relationship of lacunar infarcts with cognitive abilities (p 5 0.04). Even a few years of formal education contributes to cognitive reserve.
我们在大量受教育程度很低的人群中进行了一项临床病理学研究，以确定受教育年限是否会影响认知储备并改变神经病理学指标与痴呆症的关系。 在这项横断面研究中，我们纳入了来自巴西大脑老化研究组的 675 名 50 岁或以上的个体。 认知能力是通过在尸检时与线人进行结构化访谈来评估的，包括临床痴呆评级 (CDR) 量表。 使用免疫组织化学并遵循国际公认的标准进行神经病理学检查。 进行多元线性回归模型以确定认知能力（通过 CDR 框总和测量）与受教育年限之间的关联是否独立于社会人口学变量和神经病理学指标，包括神经炎斑块、神经原纤维缠结、腔隙性梗死、小血管 疾病和路易体。 此外，交互模型被用来检查教育是否改变了神经病理学指标和认知之间的关系。 平均受教育年限为 3.9 ± 3.5 年。 在针对社会人口学变量和神经病理学指标进行调整后，正规教育与较低的 CDR 总和相关（b = -0.197；95% 置信区间 -0.343、-0.052；p = 0.008）。 此外，教育改变了腔隙性梗死与认知能力之间的关系 (p < 5 = 0.04)。 即使是几年的正规教育也有助于形成认知储备。

The cognitive reserve theory is increasingly used to explain the clinicopathologic dissociation observed in Alzheimer disease (AD).1 Approximately 30% of cognitively normal subjects have intermediate- to high-likelihood AD pathology at autopsy.2–7 According to this theory, subjects with greater cognitive reserve require a more severe neuropathologic burden to reach the threshold for clinical dementia. Previous clinicopathologic studies suggest that although education is not directly related to the development of neuropathologic lesions, it appears to reduce the impact of such lesions on the development of dementia, thereby increasing cognitive reserve. However, the studies sup- porting this hypothesis have investigated populations with relatively high levels of educational attainment, with mean formal education ranging from 9 to 18 years.8–12 Little information is available regarding the effect of very few years of education on cognitive reserve. Low educational attainment is the reality for a high proportion of the elderly worldwide. According to a report from the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization, nearly 800 million adults remained illiterate in 2009, representing about 16% of the global population.13 *Most* of these individuals live in *developing countries*, which already are home to approximately 60% of the subjects who have dementia.14

In this study, we examined the cognitive reserve theory in a population with a *high prevalence* of extremely *low* levels of formal *education*. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that even a few years of formal education would reduce the deleterious effects of neuropatho- logic indices (i.e., AD pathologic changes, lacunar infarctions, small-vessel disease, and Lewy body pathology) on the likelihood of having cognitive impairment.

Subjects were participants in the Brazilian Aging Brain Study Group (BABSG) from the University of São Paulo. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the BABSG were previously described.15 From February 2004 to February 2009, a total of 1,980 persons aged 50 years or older were included in the BABSG. Of these, the first consecutive 675 persons underwent a complete clinical and neuropathologic diagnosis and were included in this study. The study was approved by the local ethical committee, and a voluntarily signed informed consent was obtained by the next- of-kin who provided *autopsy and brain donation* consent and permission to obtain necessary clinical and functional information. Upon arrival at the autopsy service, a knowledgeable informant was identified to provide information using a validated semistructured interview. Requirement for being an informant included having close weekly contact with the deceased subject during the last 6 months. Informants were the son or daughter in 69.9%, the spouse in 7.8%, a grandchild in 7.3%, and a sibling in 6.2% of the cases. The remaining 8.8% were other family members. Contact with the informant was categorized as daily or weekly. The interview protocol included demographic data collection of age, sex, ethnicity, and educational attainment. **Educational** attainment was obtained by inquiring about the number of years in which the deceased attended school. A series of **semistructured scales**, including the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale and the Informant Questionnaire of the Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, determined cognitive and functional status.16,17 CDR sum of boxes was obtained for all subjects. The interview was conducted by a skilled team of gerontologists. The final diagnosis was reached by consensus among an experienced gerontologist and a behavioral neurologist.受试者是圣保罗大学巴西大脑老化研究小组 (BABSG) 的参与者。 BABSG 的纳入和排除标准之前已有描述。15 从 2004 年 2 月到 2009 年 2 月，共有 1,980 名 50 岁或以上的人被纳入 BABSG。 其中，第一批连续的 675 人接受了完整的临床和神经病理学诊断，并被纳入本研究。 该研究得到了当地伦理委员会的批准，并获得了近亲自愿签署的知情同意书，他们提供了*尸检和大脑捐赠*同意书，并允许获得必要的临床和功能信息。 到达尸检服务处后，确定了一名知识渊博的线人，以使用经过验证的半结构化访谈提供信息。 成为线人的要求包括在过去 6 个月内每周与死者密切接触。 69.9%是儿子或女儿，7.8%是配偶，7.3%是孙子，6.2%是兄弟姐妹。 其余 8.8% 为其他家庭成员。 与举报人的联系分为每天或每周。 采访协议包括年龄、性别、种族和教育程度的人口统计数据收集。 **教育**程度是通过询问死者上学的年数获得的。 一系列**半结构化量表**，包括临床痴呆评分 (CDR) 量表和老年人认知衰退知情人问卷，确定了认知和功能状态。16,17 获得了所有受试者的 CDR 框总和。 访谈由一支经验丰富的老年病学家团队进行。 最终诊断由一位经验丰富的老年病学家和一位行为神经学家达成共识。

In a previous study, we prospectively compared the sensitivity and specificity of our protocol when applied to informants of living patients, with the *diagnosis established in our memory clinic* where the same patients were submitted to a full cognitive assessment, neurologic examination, and neuroimaging. Sensitivity was 86.6% and specificity was 84.4% for the diagnosis of dementia.在之前的一项研究中，我们前瞻性地比较了我们的方案在应用于活体患者的线人时的敏感性和特异性，以及*在我们的记忆诊所*中建立的诊断*，其中相同的患者接受了全面的认知评估、神经系统检查和神经影像学检查 . 诊断痴呆症的敏感性为 86.6%，特异性为 84.4%。

Socioeconomic status was determined through a Brazilian scale that classifies subjects in 5 strata. Stratum A is the highest income and stratum E the lowest. For analysis and inclusion in the multivariate model, individuals were grouped into 3 categories: low socioeconomic status (strata D and E), middle status (stratum C), and high status (strata A and B).19

Autopsy was performed within 20 hours of death. Upon brain procurement, the left hemisphere was fixed in 10% buffered paraformaldehyde for 14 to 21 days, sectioned in 1-cm-thick slabs, and inspected macroscopically. Thirteen samples (middle frontal gyrus, middle and anterior temporal gyri, angular gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus, visual cortex, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus at the level of lateral geniculate body, amygdala at the level of mammillary bodies including the ambiens gyrus, basal ganglia at the level of the anterior commissure, thalamus, midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum) were blocked in paraffin for microscopic examination. All extra macroscopic lesions were also sampled for microscopic evaluation. 尸体解剖在死亡后 20 小时内进行。 获取大脑后，将左半球固定在 10% 缓冲多聚甲醛中 14 至 21 天，切成 1 厘米厚的切片，并进行宏观检查。 13 个样本（额中回、颞中回和前回、角回、额上回和前扣带回、视觉皮层、海马和海马旁回在外侧膝状体水平，杏仁核在乳头体水平包括环境回） ，前连合水平的基底神经节、丘脑、中脑、脑桥、延髓和小脑）在石蜡中封闭用于显微镜检查。 所有额外的肉眼可见的病变也被取样用于显微镜评估。
 
All sampled regions were stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E). *Selected sections were immunostained* with antibodies against *b-amyloid* (4G8, dilution 1:10.000; Signet Pathology Systems, Dedham, MA), against *phospho-tau* (PHF-1, dilution 1:2.000; gift of Prof. Peter Davies, NY), and against *a-synuclein* (EQV-1, 1:10.000; gift of Kenji Ueda, Tokyo, Japan), as described previously.15 All sections were submitted to antigenic retrieval using a steamer. The reactions were detected using the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Whenever necessary for accurate diagnosis, other regions were immunostained and/or additional antibodies including TDP-43 were used. Neuropathologic diagnoses were conducted by 2 expe- rienced neuropathologists blinded to all clinical data. The criteria of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease were used to classify the **neuritic plaques** into 4 possible groups: *absent, sparse, moderate, or frequent*.20 The **neurofibrillary tangles** were staged according to the Braak classification in s*tages 0 to VI*. Vascular changes were analyzed semiquantitatively using H&E staining in all 13 routinely sampled areas plus additional areas with suspected vascular lesions detected at the macroscopic examination. Additional staining such as periodic acid-Schiff, Perls, and Klüver-Barrera was used at pathologist discretion. The presence of diffuse small-vessel disease, lacunae, and large infarcts was registered by topography, size, and number. **Cerebral amyloid angiopathy** was identified using immunohistochemistry for b-amyloid.所有采样区域都用苏木精和伊红 (H&E) 染色。 *选定的切片用针对*b-淀粉样蛋白*（4G8，稀释度 1:10.000；Signet 病理学系统，戴德姆，马萨诸塞州）的抗体进行免疫染色*，针对*磷-tau*（PHF-1，稀释度 1:2.000；教授的礼物 .

Small-vessel disease was assessed in all 13 areas using a 4-point scale (0–3) based on severity. The average of cortical area stages was used. The number and size of lacunar and microinfarcts were recorded in all 14 regions, using H&E-stained sections. The number of lacunar infarcts found in strategic areas to cognition (thalamus, frontocingular cortex, basal forebrain, caudate nucleus, inferotemporal gyri, hippocampus, and angular gyrus) was used for classifying lacunar infarcts on a 6-point scale (0 =none; 1 = up to 2 lacunae; 2 = up to 4 lacunae; 3 = up to 6 lacunae; 4 = up to 8 lacunae; and 5 = more than 8 lacunae).

The presence of Lewy bodies was classified using the Braak staging for Parkinson disease ranging from stages 0 to VI.23

The main dependent variable was **cognitive ability** assessed with the *CDR sum of boxes* (continuous outcome). We initially conducted univariate analysis to examine whether the groups with and without any formal education, and those with and without cognitive impairment were different regarding demographics and neuropathologic features. We used x2 tests or Fisher exact test when appropriate for categorical var- iables and unpaired t tests for continuous variables. Multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to determine whether the association between cognitive ability and education was not confounded by sociodemographic data and neuropathologic features. Education was the main independent variable and was modeled as a continuous measure. The initial model examined the associa- tion between education and cognitive ability adjusting for the effects of demographic factors including age at death, sex, socio- economic status, race, and contact with the informant. Race and socioeconomic status were coded as dummy variables. Further multivariate linear regression models were performed to adjust the association of cognitive ability and education for the presence of neuropathologic indices, measured as ordinal variables.

We conducted additional multivariate linear regression analyses with the addition of interaction terms in order to test the hypothesis that education modifies the relationship of neuropathologic indices and cognitive ability. The p values for interaction and other terms in the model were calculated using likelihood ratio tests.

The level of significance of all tests was set at 5% in 2-tailed tests. The statistical analyses were performed using Stata statistical software version 11.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).

## N. Franmeier 2017  Cognitive reserve moderates the association between functional network anti-correlations and memory in MCI 
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/4.%20Cognitive%20reserve%20moderates%20the%20association%20between%20functional%20network%20anti-correlations%20and%20memory%20in%20MCI.pdf)
### Intro
Cognitive reserve (CR) shows protective effects on cognitive function in older adults. Here, we focused on the effects of CR at the functional network level. We assessed in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) whether higher CR moderates the association between low internetwork cross-talk on memory performance. In 2 independent aMCI samples (n ¼ 76 and 93) and healthy controls (HC, n ¼ 36), CR was assessed via years of education and intelligence (IQ). We focused on the anti-correlation between the dorsal attention network (DAN) and an anterior and posterior default mode network (DMN), assessed via sliding timewindowanalysis ofresting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The DMN-DAN anti-correlation was numerically but not significantly lower in aMCI compared to HC. However, in aMCI, lower anteriorDMN-DANanti-correlationwas associated with lowermemory performance. This association was moderated by CR proxies, where the association between the internetwork anti-correlation and memory performance was alleviated at higher levels of education or IQ. In conclusion, lower DAN-DMN cross-talk is associated with lower memory in aMCI, where such effects are buffered by higher CR.  认知储备(Cognitive reserve, CR)对老年人的认知功能具有保护作用。在这里，我们关注的是CR在功能网络层面的影响。我们评估了失忆症患者轻度认知障碍(aMCI)，较高的CR是否调节了低网络相声对记忆性能的影响。在2个独立的aMCI样本(n = 76和93)和健康对照(HC, n = 36)中，CR通过教育年限和智力(IQ)进行评估。我们通过静息状态功能磁共振成像(fMRI)滑动时间窗分析，重点研究了背侧注意网络(DAN)和前后默认模式网络(DMN)之间的反相关性。与HC相比，aMCI的DMN-DAN反相关在数值上较低，但不显著降低。然而，在aMCI中，较低的前dmn - dananti -correlation与较低的记忆性能相关。这种关联受到CR代理的调节，在CR代理中，网络反相关和记忆性能之间的关联在较高的教育水平或智商水平上被减轻。综上所述，较低的DAN-DMN串扰与aMCI中较低的内存相关，而较高的CR可以缓冲这种影响。

Cognitive reserve (CR) designates the ability to cognitively perform relatively well in the presence of neuropathology and is thought to be conferred by higher mental abilities like IQ or prolonged life-time experiences such as education. The CR hypothesis is supported by findings from epidemiologic studies showing that proxy measures of CR including IQand years of formal education are associated with lower riskofdementia (Esiri and Chance, 2012;Meng andD’Arcy, 2012; Valenzuela and Sachdev, 2006; Wilson et al., 2002). Further support for the CR hypothesis comes from neuroimaging studies onmild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’sdisease (AD), which showed that patients with higher levels of CR proxy measures exhibited stronger neuropathology (such as amyloid pathology, gray matter atrophy, glucose hypometabolism) at relatively stable levels of cognitive performance (Ewers et al., 2013; Morbelli et al., 2013; Stern, 2006; Vemuri et al., 2011). CR-related effects at the level of functional brain networks, however, are not well understood (Barulli and Stern, 2013). Since previous fMRI studies showed circumscribed changes in functional networks that are linked to cognitive impairment in patients with MCI (for review see (Teipel et al., 2016)), the question arises whether higher levels of CR buffer the effects of lower neural network function on memory in MCI. Motivated by a previous finding in nondemented older adults, which showed that at higher levels of IQ, the association between amyloid pathology and episodic memory impairment was weaker (Rentz et al., 2010), we aimed to test whether at higher levels of CR (as measured by IQ or education), lower levels of functional connectivity between functional brain networks is associated with relatively milder memory impairment in MCI. 认知储备(CR)指的是在存在神经病理学的情况下，认知能力表现相对良好的能力，被认为是由更高的心理能力(如智商)或长期的生活经历(如教育)赋予的。流行病学研究的结果支持CR假说，表明包括智商和正规教育年限在内的CR替代指标与较低的痴呆风险相关(Esiri和Chance, 2012;孟和d 'Arcy, 2012;Valenzuela和Sachdev, 2006;Wilson等人，2002年)。对轻度认知障碍(MCI)和阿尔茨海默病(AD)的神经影像学研究进一步支持了CR假说，这些研究表明，CR替代指标水平较高的患者表现出更强的神经病理(如淀粉样蛋白病理、灰质萎缩、(Ewers et al.， 2013;Morbelli等人，2013年;斯特恩，2006;Vemuri等，2011)。然而，在大脑功能网络水平上，cr相关的影响还没有被很好地理解(Barulli和Stern, 2013)。由于先前的fMRI研究显示*功能网络的局限性变化*与MCI患者的*认知障碍有关*(回顾见(Teipel et al.， 2016))，因此出现了更高水平的CR是否缓冲了MCI患者较低的神经网络功能对记忆的影响的问题。基于之前在非痴呆老年人中发现的高智商水平下，淀粉样蛋白病理和情景记忆障碍之间的联系较弱(Rentz et al.， 2010)，我们旨在测试在较高水平的CR(以智商或教育水平衡量)下，在轻度认知障碍患者中，脑功能网络间的功能连接水平较低与相对较轻的记忆障碍有关。
To assess functional network changes that underlie memory impairment, we measured resting-state functional connectivity between 2 major functional networks including the *dorsal attention network (DAN)* and the *default mode network (DMN)*. Previous resting-state fMRI studies have revealed an anti-correlation between  the resting-state signal of the DMN and the DAN (Carbonell et al., 2014; Chai et al., 2014; Fox et al., 2005), where *greater DMN-DAN anti-correlation* was associated with higher cognitive control and *better working memory performance* (Anticevic et al., 2012; Chai et al., 2014; Hampson et al., 2010; Kelly et al., 2008). The restingstate DMN-DAN anti-correlation is reminiscent of observations from task-related fMRI studies showing a task activation of the DAN concomitant with a deactivation of the DMN to be associated with higher episodic memory performance in cognitively normal individuals (Kim et al., 2010; Kragel and Polyn, 2015; Landsiedel and Gilbert, 2015). Here, we hypothesized that in amnestic MCIeaclinical syndrome characterized bymemory impairmentelower levels of the DMN-DAN anti-correlation are associated with low memory performance and that such an association can be buffered by CR. Although the anti-correlation of the DAN and DMN itself was not pathologically altered before the stage of AD dementia in previous studies (Wang et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2016), we hypothesized that the level ofthe anti-correlation ofthe DMN-DAN is predictive ofmemory impairment in the diseased brain (MCI) at low levels of CR. The rationale is that the reciprocal activation of the DAN and DMN has a central regulating role within the ensemble of functional networks underlying cognition (Cole et al., 2014), which becomes especially crucial to maintain successful cognitive processes including memory at the stage of MCI and low CR. 为了评估记忆损伤背后的功能网络变化，我们*测量了两个主要功能网络之间的静息状态功能连接*，包括背侧注意网络(DAN)和默认模式网络(DMN)。之前的静息态fMRI研究已经揭示了DMN和DAN的静息态信号之间的反相关(Carbonell等人，2014;柴等，2014;福克斯等人，2005年)，其中更高的DMNeDAN反相关与更高的认知控制和更好的工作记忆表现相关(Anticevic等人，2012年;柴等，2014;汉普森等人，2010年;Kelly等人，2008)。静息状态下的DMN-DAN反相关让人想起任务相关的功能磁共振成像研究的观察结果，该研究显示，在认知正常的个体中，*DAN的任务激活与DMN的失活相伴随，与更高的情景记忆表现相关*(Kim et al.， 2010;Kragel and Polyn, 2015;Landsiedel and Gilbert, 2015)。给，我们*假设*，在以记忆障碍为特征的失忆症mci临床综合征中，DMN-DAN*反相关水平较低*与*低记忆*表现相关，并且这种关联可以*被CR缓冲*。尽管DAN和DMN本身的反相关在AD痴呆阶段之前没有病理改变在之前的研究中(Wang et al.， 2007;我们假设，在低CR水平下，DMN-DAN的反相关水平可以预测病变大脑的记忆损伤(MCI)。其基本原理是，DAN和DMN的交互激活在认知基础的功能网络集成中具有中心调节作用(Cole等人，2016)。这对于维持MCI和低CR阶段的记忆等成功的认知过程尤为重要。

To assess the DAN-DMN anti-correlation, we applied functional connectivity analysis of the DMN-DAN anti-correlation in 2 independent samples of amnestic MCI patients for cross-validation of the results. Via sliding time window functional connectivity analysis, we identified episodes of peak anti-correlations between the networks during resting-state fMRI (Allen et al., 2014; Chang and Glover, 2010; Hutchison et al., 2013a; Sadaghiani et al., 2015; Zalesky et al., 2014). Subsequently, we tested the hypothesis that higher levels of CR proxies (IQ or years of education) moderate the relationship lower levels of peak DMN-DAN anti-correlation and memory impairment in MCI. We included patients with the clinical syndrome of amnestic MCI patients, both single- and multipledomain amnestic types, regardless of underlying etiology. To assess whether presence of AD pathology (increased levels of amyloid PET) or genetic risk of AD (ApoE ε4 genotype) influence the effect of CR proxies on the relationship between DMN-DAN anticorrelation and memory impairment, we controlled for both amyloid PET levels and APOE genotype. 为了评估DAN-DMN的抗相关性，我们在2个独立的失忆性MCI患者样本中应用了DMN-DAN抗相关性的功能连通性分析来交叉验证结果。通过滑动时间窗功能连接分析，我们确定了静息态fMRI期间网络之间的反相关性峰值(Allen等人，2014;Chang和Glover, 2010;Hutchison et al.， 2013a;Sadaghiani等人，2015年;Zalesky等，2014)。随后，我们测试了假设，即较高水平的CR指标(智商或教育年限)调节了MCI中DMN-DAN峰值反相关水平和记忆障碍水平的降低。我们纳入了具有遗忘性MCI患者临床综合征的患者，包括单域和多域遗忘类型，而不管潜在的病因。为了评估AD病理(淀粉样PET水平升高)或AD遗传风险(ApoE ε4基因型)是否影响CR代理在DMN-DAN抗相关和记忆障碍之间的作用，我们控制了淀粉样PET水平和ApoE基因型。

A total of *76* patients with amnestic *MCI* (MCI) and *36 healthy* older adults (HC) were included from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (*ADNI*) (Petersen et al., 2010). For *crossvalidation* purposes, we included a sample of *93* patients with *MCI*, who were recruited at the memory clinic of the Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research (*ISD*), Klinikum der Universitaet Muenchen, Munich (henceforth referred to as the ISD sample). In the ADNI study, MCI was diagnosed according to the Petersen (Petersen, 2004) criteria. MCI patients showed Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores between 24 and 30 (inclusive), subjective and objective memory loss as defined by scores 1.5 SD below age and education adjusted scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II, a CDR of 0.5, and absence of significant levels of impairment on other cognitive domains. An individual was defined as HC when showing an MMSE score between 24 and 30 (inclusive), a CDR of 0, no signs of depression, and no objective memory loss (for further details on diagnostic guidelines and neuropsychological examinations please 共有76名失忆症MCI (MCI)患者和36名健康老年人(HC)被纳入阿尔茨海默病神经成像倡议(ADNI) (Petersen等人，2010)。为了交叉验证的目的，我们纳入了93名MCI患者的样本，他们是在慕尼黑克利尼库姆大学中风和痴呆研究所(ISD)的记忆诊所招募的(以后称为ISD样本)。在ADNI研究中，轻度认知障碍是根据Petersen (Petersen, 2004)标准诊断的。MCI患者的Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)得分在24 - 30分(包括30分)之间，主观和客观记忆损失定义为1.5 SD，低于年龄和教育程度韦氏记忆量表逻辑记忆II的调整分数，CDR为0.5，在其他认知领域没有显著水平的损伤。当MMSE评分在24 - 30分(含)之间，CDR为0，无抑郁症状，无客观记忆丧失时，被定义为HC(请进一步了解诊断指南和神经心理检查的详细信息)

Beyond the inclusion criteria defined by ADNI, additional requirements for the inclusion in the present study had to be met, consisting ofthe availability ofresting-state fMRI, T1-weighted MRI images, [18-F] AV-45 amyloid PET and comprehensive neuropsychological test scores. Amyloid beta (Ab) levels in the brain were determined based on a global measure of [18-F] AV-45 PET binding, which is provided by the ADNI PET core as a summary measure of several cortical ROIs that have been described previously (Landau et al., 2013). Specifically, an abnormally high Ab level was defined according to an a priori established cutoff value (Landau et al., 2013), i.e., a global AV-45 PET binding (SUVR) 	1.11 (Abþ,n ¼ 44 for MCI; n ¼ 13 for HC). Normal low Ab levels (AV-45 PET binding [SUVR] <1.11, Ab	) were present in 32 MCI and 23 HC. In the ISD study, MCI was also diagnosed according to the Petersen (Petersen, 2004) criteria. MCIwas defined as a score 1.5 SD below the norm (adjusted for age, education) on at least one of the memory subtests (word list or figure learning/recall) of the CERAD-Plus battery (Luck et al., 2009). All MCI patients underwent resting-state fMRI, T1-weighted MRI, and comprehensive neuropsychological testing. Additional inclusion criteria consisted of age >55 years, absence of symptoms of depression, other neurological disorders, uncontrolled arterial hypertension or diabetes mellitus or a history ofalcohol or drug abuse. The ISD-MCI patients had been recruited for a cognitive intervention trial at the ISD [registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01525368 as “Outcome Predictors ofa Cognitive Intervention in aMCI”; see (Franzmeier et al., 2016) for details]. However, for the present study, we used only baseline data that were assessed before the cognitive intervention. 除ADNI定义的纳入标准外，本研究还必须满足其他纳入要求，包括静息状态fMRI、t1加权MRI图像、[18-F] AV-45淀粉样PET和综合神经心理测试评分。大脑中的淀粉样蛋白β (Ab)水平是根据[18-F] AV-45 PET结合的整体测量来确定的，这是由ADNI PET核心提供的，作为先前描述的几个皮质roi的总结测量(Landau等人，2013)。具体来说，异常高的抗体水平是根据一个先验确定的截断值来定义的(Landau et al.， 2013)，即，一个整体AV-45 PET结合(SUVR) 1.11 (Abþ，n¼44对于MCI;n¼13对于HC)。正常低抗体水平(AV-45 PET结合[SUVR] <1.11, Ab)出现在32例MCI和23例HC中。在ISD研究中，轻度认知障碍也是根据Petersen (Petersen, 2004)标准诊断的。mci的定义是，在CERAD-Plus电池的至少一项记忆测试(单词列表或数字学习/回忆)中，得分比标准(根据年龄、教育程度调整)低1.5个标准差(Luck等人，2009年)。所有MCI患者都进行了静息状态fMRI、t1加权MRI和综合神经心理测试。其他纳入标准包括:年龄> - 55岁，无抑郁症症状、其他神经系统疾病、无控制的动脉高血压或糖尿病，或有酒精或药物滥用史。ISD- mci患者被招募到ISD进行认知干预试验[在www.clinicaltrials.gov上注册为NCT01525368，作为“aMCI认知干预的预后预测因子”;详见(Franzmeier et al.， 2016)]。然而，在目前的研究中，我们只使用认知干预前评估的基线数据。

For the ADNI sample, ethical approval was obtained by the ADNI investigators (for details see: http://www.adni-info.org/pdfs/adni_ protocol_9_19_08.pdf). Recruitment of the ISD sample was approved by the ethics committee of the Ludwig Maximilian University Munich. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and the applicable revisions at the time of the investigation. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients for being included in the study. 对于ADNI样本，ADNI研究人员获得了伦理许可(详情见:http://www.adni-info.org/pdfs/adni_ protocol_9_19_08.pdf)。ISD样本的招募得到了慕尼黑路德维希马克西米兰大学伦理委员会的批准。所有程序都是根据1975年《赫尔辛基宣言》和调查时适用的修订进行的。所有患者均获得书面知情同意纳入本研究。

To estimate memory performance, we used the *ADNI-MEM score*, a composite measure of episodic memory based on a broad battery of neuropsychological memory tests, as described previously for the ADNI study (Crane et al., 2012). Briefly, the ADNI-MEM score takes into account scores of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, AD Assessment ScaleeCognitive Subscale, word recall (3 words) of the MMSE and the Wechsler Logical Memory Scale II. For the ISD-Munich sample, we generated a memory composite score via a similar approach that was used for the ADNI-MEM score (Crane et al., 2012). Here, we selected cognitive tests that are similar regarding test construction and measure the same neuropsychological construct (i.e., memory). To this end, we used the verbal memory subtests of the CERAD-Plus battery (Luck et al., 2009), the learning and recall subscales of the German version of the California Verbal Learning Test (Woods et al., 2006), and the word list learning and recall subtest of the AD Assessment Scale (Rozzini et al., 2008). Next, we applied maximum-likelihood confirmatory factor analysis to these memory tests, using a single factor model. The analysis yielded factor weights for each memory test loading on a principal factor with an eigenvalue of 9.14, indicating that the composite score captures considerably more variance than a single measure. For each  subject, the factor score was computed and ==z-score transformed== to be used as a ==*summary memory index*== in the subsequent analyses. 为了评估记忆表现，我们使用了ADNI- mem评分，这是一种基于一系列神经心理记忆测试的情景记忆的复合测量方法，如之前ADNI研究中所述(Crane et al.， 2012)。简而言之，ADNI-MEM评分考虑了Rey听觉语言学习测试、AD评估量表、认知分量表、MMSE的单词回忆(3个单词)和韦氏逻辑记忆量表II的分数。对于ISD-Munich样本，我们采用与ADNI-MEM评分相似的方法生成了记忆复合评分(Crane等人，2012)。在这里，我们选择了与测试结构相似的认知测试，并测量了相同的神经心理学结构(即记忆)。为此，我们使用了CERAD-Plus电池的文字记忆子测试(Luck等人，2009年)、德语版本的加州语言学习测试(Woods等人，2006年)的学习和回忆子测试，以及AD评估量表的单词列表学习和回忆子测试(Rozzini等人，2008年)。接下来，我们使用单因素模型对这些记忆测试进行了最大似然验证性因素分析。分析得出每个加载特征值为9.14的主因子的记忆测试的因子权重，表明复合分数捕获的方差比单一测量多得多。对于每个受试者，因子得分被计算，z得分被转换为在随后的分析中用作总结记忆指数。

For the ADNI study, we employed *years of formal education* and *premorbid verbal IQ* [as assessed via the American national adult reading test; ANART (Bright et al., 2002)] as commonly used CR proxies (Stern, 2012). For the ISD study, we applied the premorbid verbal IQassessed via the German multiple vocabulary test (Hessler et al., 2013; Valenzuela and Sachdev, 2006). We did not use years of education in the ISD sample because many older patients in Germany experienced their educational years during or shortly after World War II, which did compromise the educational system and may limit the reliability of the number of years of education as a proxy of CR. Thus, *we focused on IQ as a CR proxy*, whose scoring procedure is independent of the number of years of education. Since both education and IQ are frequently used proxies of CR and have been shown to be correlated (Nucci et al., 2012; Tucker and Stern, 2011), they both relate to CR. Hence, the interpretation of results should be similar. 在ADNI的研究中，我们采用了多年的正规教育和疾病前的语言智商(通过美国国家成人阅读测试进行评估;ANART (Bright et al.， 2002))作为常用的CR代理(Stern, 2012)。在ISD研究中，我们应用了通过德语多词汇测试评估的病前语言智商(Hessler等人，2013;Valenzuela和Sachdev, 2006)。我们没有在ISD样本中使用教育年数，因为许多德国老年患者在二战期间或战后不久经历了他们的教育年数，这确实损害了教育系统，并可能限制了作为CR代表的教育年数的可靠性。因此，我们将智商作为CR代表，其评分程序与受教育年限无关。因为教育和智商都是cr的常用代用指标，并且已经被证明是相关的(Nucci et al.， 2012;Tucker和Stern, 2011)，它们都与CR有关，因此对结果的解释应该是相似的。

In the ADNI study, scanning was performed on Philips 3T MRI scanners, using an 8-channel head matrix coil. T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired using a 3-dimensional (3D) MPRAGE sequence, with whole brain coverage and 1 	 1 	 1.2 mm voxel resolution. Resting-state fMRI images were recorded using a single shot T2-weighted echo planer imaging (EPI) pulse sequence in transverse slice orientation, with a repetition time of 3000 ms, a flip angle of80	, and 3.3-mm isotropic voxel resolution. The restingstate fMRI sequence comprised a total number of 140 volumes. In the ISD study, scanning was performed on a Siemens 3T Magnetom Verio Scanner with a 12-channel head matrix coil. T1weighted anatomical images were acquired using a 3D MPRAGE sequence with whole brain coverage and an isotropic voxel resolution of 1 mm. Resting-state fMRI images were acquired using a T2-weighted EPI pulse sequence in transverse slice orientation with a repetition time of 3000 ms, a flip angle of 80	, 3-mm isotropic voxel resolution, and a total number of 120 volumes. 在ADNI研究中，使用飞利浦3T MRI扫描仪进行扫描，使用8通道头部矩阵线圈。采用三维MPRAGE序列获取t1加权解剖图像，全脑覆盖，体素分辨率为1 1 1.2 mm。采用单脉冲T2加权回波平面成像(EPI)脉冲序列记录静息态fMRI图像，重复时间为3000 ms，翻转角度为80，各向同性体素分辨率为3.3 mm。静息状态fMRI序列包含140个容量。在ISD研究中，使用西门子3T Magnetom Verio扫描仪进行扫描，该扫描仪配有12通道头部矩阵线圈。T1weighted解剖图像采用全脑覆盖、各向同性体素分辨率为1 mm的3D MPRAGE序列获取。静息态fMRI图像采集采用T2加权EPI脉冲序列，横向切片方向，重复时间为3000 ms，翻转角度为80，各向同性体素分辨率为3 mm，共120个体积。All preprocessing steps were conducted using SPM 12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London). The same preprocessing protocol, if not otherwise noted, was applied to the resting-state fMRI scans from ADNI and ISD. For each subject, the first 10 volumes of the fMRI time series were discarded because of known instabilities of the MR signal at the beginning of the fMRI acquisition. The remaining volumes were realigned to the first volume, motion corrected, and coregistered to native space 3D T1-weighted images and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum of 8 mm. Preprocessed resting-state fMRI images were then spatially normalized using DARTEL (Ashburner, 2007), where the spatial normalization parameters and the creation of customized gray matter templates were done separately for the ADNI and ISD groups to avoid biases due to scanner differences between both studies. However, the same, spatial normalization protocol was used for both ADNI and ISD. In a first step, high-resolution 3D T1-weighted images were segmented in gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) maps, using SPM’s new-segment approach (Ashburner and Friston, 2005). Based on the segmentations, we applied a diffeomorphic high-dimensional registration algorithm to warp  individual subject brains to a common space that is defined in an iterative procedure, as implemented in the SPM 12 toolbox DARTEL (Ashburner, 2007). The resulting gray matter group template was then affine registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template of T1 images implemented in DARTEL. The DARTEL flow fields and affine registration transformation matrix were subsequently combined and applied to each subjects’ coregistered fMRI volumes for spatial normalization to the MNI template. 所有的预处理步骤都使用spm12(伦敦大学学院威康信托神经成像中心)进行。对于ADNI和ISD的静息状态fMRI扫描，采用相同的预处理协议(如果没有其他说明)。对于每个受试者，由于已知在fMRI采集开始时MR信号的不稳定性，将前10卷fMRI时间序列丢弃。剩余的体块重新对齐到第一个体块，运动校正，并与本地空间3D t1加权图像进行共配准，并使用全宽度为最大8 mm的一半的高斯核进行平滑。然后使用DARTEL (Ashburner, 2007)对预处理后的静置状态fMRI图像进行空间归一化处理，其中ADNI组和ISD组的空间归一化参数和定制灰质模板的创建分别进行，以避免由于两项研究之间的扫描仪差异而产生的偏差。然而，同样的，空间归一化协议被用于ADNI和ISD。在第一步中，使用SPM的新分割方法，将高分辨率的3D t1加权图像分割到灰质(GM)、白质(WM)和脑脊液(CSF)图中(Ashburner和Friston, 2005)。在分割的基础上，我们应用了一种微分纯高维配准算法，将个体主体的大脑扭曲到一个在迭代过程中定义的公共空间，在spm12工具箱DARTEL中实现(Ashburner, 2007)。然后将得到的灰质组模板仿射注册到蒙特利尔神经学研究所(MNI)在DARTEL中实现的T1图像模板。随后结合DARTEL流场和仿射配准变换矩阵，应用于每个受试者的共配准fMRI体积，对MNI模板进行空间归一化。To remove noise from the EPI images, the spatially normalized resting-state fMRI images were detrended and band-pass filtered with a frequency band of 0.01e0.08 Hz. In addition, we regressed out the 6 motion parameters and the BOLD signal averaged across the WM and CSF. Since we were specifically interested in anticorrelations between DMN and DAN, we did not perform global signal regression, which may artificially introduce anti-correlations between resting-state fMRI signal changes of the DMN and DAN (Carbonell et al., 2014; Chai et al., 2012; Murphy et al., 2009; Spreng et al., 2016). To create GM masks, we averaged spatially normalized but unmodulated GM maps, followed by binarization (voxel value >0.3), whichwas conducted separately within the ADNI and the ISD groups. For the extraction of GM volume, we additionally created spatially normalized GM maps for each subject, that were smoothed with an 8-mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel, following a previously described approach (Mak et al., 2011). During the normalization step, modulationwas applied so that local concentrations of gray matter are preserved after warping the image to template space. 为了去除EPI图像中的噪声，对空间归一化的静息态fMRI图像进行去趋势处理，并对其进行频带滤波，频带范围为0.01e0.08 Hz。此外，我们回归出6个运动参数和穿越WM和CSF平均的BOLD信号。由于我们对DMN和DAN之间的反相关关系特别感兴趣，我们没有进行全局信号回归，这可能人为地引入了DMN和DAN静息态fMRI信号变化之间的反相关关系(Carbonell et al.， 2014;柴等，2012;Murphy等人，2009年;Spreng等人，2016)。为了创建GM蒙版，我们平均了空间归一化但未调制的GM地图，然后进行二值化(体素值>0.3)，这在ADNI和ISD组中分别进行。为了提取GM体积，我们还为每个受试者创建了空间归一化GM地图，按照前面描述的方法，在半最大高斯核下使用8毫米全宽进行平滑(Mak等人，2011)。在归一化步骤中，应用了调制，使图像在扭曲到模板空间后，保留了局部的灰质浓度。

Spatial group ICA (Calhoun and Adali, 2012) on preprocessed resting-state fMRI data was performed using the Infomax Algorithm implemented in the GIFT-Toolbox (http://mialab.mrn.org/ software/gift). The ICAs of resting-state fMRI scans were run separately for the ADNI and ISD samples. The number of independent components (ICs) to extract was a priori set to 20, which has previously been shown to robustly identify the DMN and DAN (Di and Biswal, 2014). To estimate the reliability of the resulting IC decomposition, the Infomax Algorithm was repeated 10 times in ICASSO (http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/icasso). All components showed stability indices greater than 0.95 in both groups suggesting that the components extracted by the group ICA algorithm show a high reliability. In line with earlier studies (Damoiseaux et al., 2012; Di and Biswal, 2014; Jones et al., 2011, 2012; Smith et al., 2009), we found the DMN to be subdivided into an anterior (aDMN) and a posterior (pDMN) component in both ADNI and ISD samples (see Fig. 1). The identification of the networks was confirmed by spatial regression matching the group ICA maps to the IC templates of major resting state networks (Laird et al., 2011). After group ICA, subject-specific IC maps and time courses (TCs) for the aDMN, pDMN, and DAN were back-reconstructed using GICA3 algorithm (Erhardt et al., 2011). 使用gift - toolbox (http://mialab.mrn.org/ software/gift)中实现的Infomax算法对预处理后的静息状态fMRI数据进行空间组ICA (Calhoun和Adali, 2012)。对ADNI和ISD样本分别运行静息态fMRI扫描的ICAs。提取的独立分量(ICs)的数量先验设置为20，这已被证明可以稳健地识别DMN和DAN (Di和Biswal, 2014)。为了估计得到的IC分解的可靠性，在ICASSO (http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/icasso)中重复了10次Infomax算法。两组分量的稳定性指标均大于0.95，说明组ICA算法提取的分量具有较高的可靠性。根据早期的研究(Damoiseaux等，2012;Di和Biswal, 2014;Jones等人，2011,2012;Smith等人，2009)，我们发现在ADNI和ISD样本中，DMN被细分为前(aDMN)和后(pDMN)成分(见图1)。网络的识别是通过空间回归匹配组ICA映射到主要休息状态网络的IC模板来确定的(Laird等人，2011)。ICA组后，使用GICA3算法反向重构aDMN、pDMN和DAN的学科特定IC图和时间过程(tc) (Erhardt等，2011)。We applied sliding time window analysis on the ICA derived component time courses to estimate peaks of anti-correlation between the aDMN versus DAN pair and the pDMN versus DAN pair (See Fig. 2 for illustration of the analysis). To this end, we used the GIFT-Toolbox (Allen et al., 2014), applying a sliding time window with a width of 30 repetition time (TR)’s (equivalent to 90 seconds of MRI acquisition) shifted in steps of 1 TR on the time courses of the 3 ICs. In line with previous studies, the rectangular time  window was convolved with a Gaussian sigma of 3 TRs to achieve tapering near the edges (Allen et al., 2014). Within each time window, we computed the Pearson moment correlation between the ICA time courses of each DMN component and the DAN. Sliding the window successively yielded a continuous graph reflecting internetwork correlations over the entire duration of the restingstate scan for each subject (Fig. 2). As a measure of peak anticorrelation between the networks, we computed the mean correlation coefficient across those consecutive 10 time windows (equivalent to 40 TR’s or 120 seconds of MRI acquisition) that surrounded the time window showing the highest anti-correlation between the networks’ time courses. To test the impact of time window selection on our findings, we conducted all analyses thrice, using the mean of the 5 or 15 time windows (equivalent to 105 and 135 seconds of resting-state fMRI) showing the highest negative correlations. Window selection did not change the result pattern of our statistical analyses testing our hypothesis as reported in the following. We further aimed to assess whether changes in peak functional connectivity were confounded by spontaneous head motion (Power et al., 2012). To this end, we computed the framewise displacement (FD) for each subjects’ resting-state scan, following a previously described approach (Power et al., 2012). In brief, the FD indexes the relative head movement between subsequent EPI volumes and is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the differentiated realignment estimates at every timepoint. Subsequently, we computed the overall mean FD, the mean FD within those time windows encompassing the peak anticorrelations as well as the mean FD of all remaining time windows. 我们对ICA衍生的分量时间过程进行滑动时间窗分析，以估计aDMN与DAN对以及pDMN与DAN对之间的反相关峰(分析说明见图2)。为此，我们使用了GIFT-Toolbox (Allen et al.， 2014)，应用了一个滑动时间窗口，宽度为30重复时间(TR)’s(相当于MRI采集的90秒)，在3个ic的时间过程中以1 TR的步骤移动。与之前的研究一致，将矩形时间N. Franzmeier等人/ Neurobiology of Aging 50 (2017) 152e162 154窗口与3 TRs的Gaussian sigma卷积，以实现靠近边缘的锥形(Allen et al.， 2014)。在每个时间窗口内，我们计算了每个DMN分量和DAN的ICA时间过程之间的皮尔逊矩相关。连续滑动窗口产生了一个连续的图表，反映了每个受试者在静息状态扫描的整个持续时间内的网络间相关性(图2)。作为网络间峰值反相关的度量，我们计算了连续10个时间窗口(相当于40 TR或120秒的MRI采集)的平均相关系数，这些时间窗口周围显示网络时间过程之间最高的反相关。为了测试时间窗口选择对我们研究结果的影响，我们进行了三次分析，使用5或15个时间窗口的平均值(相当于105和135秒的静息状态功能磁共振成像)，显示出最高的负相关性。窗口选择并没有改变我们检验假设的统计分析的结果模式，如下所述。我们进一步旨在评估峰值功能连通性的变化是否与自发性头部运动相混淆(Power et al.， 2012)。为此，我们按照之前描述的方法(Power et al.， 2012)，计算了每个受试者静息状态扫描的框架位移(FD)。简而言之，FD对后续EPI体积之间的相对磁头运动进行了指数化，并将其计算为每个时间点的差动调整估计的绝对值之和。随后，我们计算了总体平均FD，包括峰值抗相关性的那些时间窗口内的平均FD，以及所有剩余时间窗口的平均FD。As a validation measure to the peak anti-correlation assessed via the sliding time window approach, we computed the more common between-network connectivity averaged across the whole resting-state scan similar to previous studies (Fox et al., 2005; Uddin et al., 2009). To this end, we assessed the Pearson moment correlation between the ICA-derived component whole-scan time courses of each DMN component and the DAN component. To later address confounding effects of head motion, we also computed the mean FD averaged across the whole resting-state scan. To extract the specific mean stationary FC within the network components for each individual, we binarized the group component maps of the aDMN, pDMN, and DAN at a threshold of z-score > 3. The binarized IC masks were then superimposed onto each individuals’ respective IC map to compute a mean z-score transformed independent component value for each network and individual, reflecting intranetwork FC 作为通过滑动时间窗方法评估峰值反相关的验证措施，我们计算了整个静止状态扫描中更常见的网络间平均连接，类似于之前的研究(Fox等人，2005;乌丁等人，2009年)。为此，我们评估了每个DMN分量和DAN分量的ica衍生分量的全扫描时间过程之间的皮尔逊力矩相关性。为了稍后解决头部运动的混淆效应，我们还计算了整个静息状态扫描的平均FD。为了提取每个个体在网络组件中的特定平均平稳FC，我们将aDMN、pDMN和DAN的组组件映射二值化，其阈值为z-score > 3。然后将二值化的IC掩码叠加到每个人各自的IC图上，计算出每个网络和个人转换后的独立组件值的平均值z-score，反映内网FC. To control for potentially confounding effects of GM atrophy in the analysis of the resting-state anti-correlation between a(p)DMN and DAN, we computed the gray matter volume within the spatial intersection between the binary GM mask and binarized (threshold z > 3) aDMN-DAN and pDMN-DAN maps. Specifically, we extracted the aDMN-DAN and pDMN-DAN GM volume for each subject from the modulated, smoothed, and normalized GM maps that were created during the preprocessing of structural MRI images. All volumetric measures were subsequently adjusted to intracranial volume (i.e., the sum of CSF, WM, and GM maps). 在分析a(p)DMN和DAN之间的静定态反相关时，为了控制GM萎缩的潜在混淆效应，我们计算了二值GM掩模和二值化(阈值z > 3) aDMN-DAN和pDMN-DAN地图之间的空间交点内的灰质体积。具体来说，我们从结构MRI图像预处理过程中创建的调制、平滑和归一化GM图中提取每个受试者的aDMN-DAN和pDMN-DAN GM体积。所有体积测量随后调整到颅内体积(即CSF、WM和GM图的总和)。

Demographics between all study groups were compared using t tests for continuous variables and chi-squared test for categorical variables. Next, we assessed in the ADNI sample, whether the peak Fig. 1. ICA results. Resting-state networks identified via group independent component analysis (depicted in radiological convention).

N. Franzmeier et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 50 (2017) 152e162 155  aDMN-DAN or pDMN-DAN anti-correlations (henceforth referred to as a(p)DMN-DAN anti-correlation) were pathologically reduced in MCI, using analysis of covariance with group (MCI vs. HC) as independent variable, controlling for age, gender, and education. To address our main hypothesis that CR proxies moderate the relationship between the a(p)DMN-DAN anti-correlation and memory, we applied all regression analyses described below separately for the peak aDMN-DAN and peak pDMN-DAN anticorrelations. In all interaction models, CR proxies and the peak aDMN-DAN anti-correlation were entered as continuous measures. For illustrational purposes, interactions are, however, visualized by binarizing CR groups via median split. 对连续变量采用t检验，对分类变量采用卡方检验，比较所有研究组之间的人口统计学特征。接下来，我们评估在ADNI样本中，是否峰值图1。ICA结果。通过群独立分量分析确定的静息态网络(在放射学公约中描述)。将两个研究样本(ADNI和ISD)的组成分叠加在MNI模板上，并在z-score >3处设定阈值。缩写:ADNI，阿尔茨海默病神经成像倡议;DAN，背侧注意网络;DMN，默认模式网络;独立成分分析;中风和痴呆研究所。使用组间协方差分析(MCI vs. HC)作为独立变量，控制年龄、性别和教育程度，MCI中adm - dan或pDMN-DAN反相关(今后称为(p)DMN-DAN反相关)在病理上降低。为了解决我们的主要假设，即CR代理调节a(p)DMN-DAN反相关与记忆之间的关系，我们分别对峰aDMN-DAN和峰pDMN-DAN的反相关进行了如下所有回归分析。在所有交互作用模型中，CR代理和aDMN-DAN反相关峰均作为连续指标输入。不过，为了便于说明，交互作用可以通过中值分割对CR组进行二值化来可视化。
For the ADNI sample, we tested the main and interaction effect of CR × peak a(p)DMN-DAN anti-correlation on ADNI-MEM (memory composite), with additional *covariates* including *age, gender, AV-45 PET* status (Ab+ vs Ab-), *a(p)DMN-DANGMvolume and mean FD* within the time windows of peak a(p)DMN-DAN anti-correlation. To investigate whether moderating effects of CR were different for Ab positive or negative MCI patients, we also tested the 3-way interaction effect ofAV-45 PET status 	x peak a(p) DMN-DAN anti-correlation 	x CR on the ADNI-MEM score, controlling for age and gender and a(p)DMN-DAN GM volume and mean FD within the time windows of peak a(p)DMN-DAN anticorrelation. To assess whether results were specific for peak functional connectivity, we conducted confirmatory analyses using the static *whole time course instead of the peak a(p)DMN-DAN anti-correlation*. For cross-validation purposes, we applied the same regression analyses to the MCI patients of the ISD study. Although Ab levels were not assessed in the ISD sample, we included the Apolipoprotein (APOE) genotype (i.e., ε4 allele carrier vs. non-carrier) as a covariate indexing an individuals’ risk of presence of AD pathology. 对于ADNI样本，我们测试了CR峰a(p)DMN-DAN反相关对ADNI- mem(记忆复合材料)的主要作用和相互作用，附加的协变量包括年龄、性别、AV-45 PET状态(Abþ vs ab)、a(p)DMN-DANGMvolume和a峰a(p)DMN-DAN反相关时间窗内的平均FD。为了研究CR对Ab阳性或阴性MCI患者的调节作用是否不同，我们还测试了av -45 PET状态峰a(p) DMN-DAN抗相关CR对ADNI-MEM评分的3-way交互作用。控制年龄、性别和a(p)DMN-DAN GM体积和平均FD在a(p)DMN-DAN抗相关的高峰时间窗口内。为了评估结果是否对峰功能连通性具有特异性，我们使用静态全时间过程而不是峰a(p)DMN-DAN反相关进行了验证性分析。为了交叉验证的目的，我们对ISD研究中的MCI患者应用了相同的回归分析。虽然在ISD样本中未评估抗体水平，但我们纳入了载脂蛋白(APOE)基因型(即ε4等位基因携带者与非携带者)，作为个体存在AD病理风险的协变量指标。
To assess whether stronger reductions in the peak a(p)DMN-DAN anti-correlation were driven by AD-specific brain changes  (i.e., Ab deposition), we applied linear regression analyses, including the peak a(p)DMN-DAN anti-correlation as the dependent variable, and global AV-45 PET uptake as the predictor, controlling for age, gender, and education. Finally, we tested in linear regression analyses the association between the peak a(p)DMN-DAN anti-correlation and the mean (stationary) within-network functional connectivity, to assess whether the relationship between-network connectivity was influenced by the within-network integrity. To this end, we included the peak a(p)DMN-DANanti-correlation as the dependent measure, and the CR proxy, mean within-network functional connectivity of the a(p)DMN and DAN as predictors, controlling for the memory composite score, age, gender the AV-45 PET status (ADNI sample) or the APOE genotype (ISD sample). To eliminate methodological concerns, we tested whether head motionwas in- or decreased during episodes ofpeak a(p)DMN-DAN anti-correlation versus the remaining resting-state scan. To this end, we applied Wilcoxon tests (due to nonnormal distribution of mean FD), testing differences between mean FD within time windows of peak a(p)DMN-DAN anti-correlation against mean FD within the remaining time windows.We further tested whether the peak a(p)DMN-DAN anti-correlation correlated with mean FD in that time windows. 为了评估a峰(p)DMN-DAN反相关是否由ad特异性脑改变(即Ab沉积)驱动，我们应用了线性回归分析，包括a峰(p)DMN-DAN反相关作为dependent variable, AV-45 PET整体摄取作为预测因子，控制年龄、性别和教育程度。最后，我们在线性回归分析中检验了峰值a(p)DMN-DAN反相关与平均(平稳)网络内功能连通性之间的关联，以评估网络连接之间的关系是否受到网络内完整性的影响。为此，我们将峰值a(p)DMN-DAN反相关作为依赖测量，CR代理，a(p)DMN和DAN的平均网络内功能连接性作为预测因子，控制记忆复合评分、年龄、性别、AV-45 PET状态(ADNI样本)或APOE基因型(ISD样本)。为了消除方法上的担忧，我们测试了在峰值DMN-DAN反相关发作期间，与其余静息状态扫描相比，头部运动是否处于-或减少。为此，我们采用了Wilcoxon检验(由于平均FD的非正态分布)，检验了峰值a(p)DMN-DAN反相关的时间窗口内平均FD与剩余时间窗口内平均FD的差异。我们进一步测试峰值a(p)DMN-DAN反相关是否与该时间窗口的平均FD相关。Linear model assumptions were tested using the gvlma package in R. For all models reported, no significant deviations for linear model assumptions were found (alpha threshold ¼ 0.05). All statistical analyses were conducted in R statistical software (Version 2.13.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

## EDPF. Resende 2018. Primary School Education May Be Sufficient to Moderate a Memory-Hippocampal Relationship
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/18.%20Primary%20school%20education%20may%20be%20sufficient%20to%20moderate%20a%20memory-hippocampal%20relationship.pdf)
### Intro
According to the cognitive reserve theory, intellectual stimuli acquired during life can prevent against developing cognitive impairment. The underlying cognitive reserve mechanisms were underexplored in low-educated individuals. Because episodic memory impairment due to hippocampal dysfunction is a key feature of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD), we sought to look at a possible cognitive reserve mechanism by determining whether few years of education moderated the relationship between the *hippocampal volumes* and the *episodic-memory* scores. The sample was composed by 183 older adults, 40.1% male, with the median age of 78[76,82] years and the median years of education of 4[2,10] who had undergone an episodic-memory test and a 3-Tesla MRI scan to access the hippocampal volumes. Overall, 112 were *cognitively healthy*, *26* had *cognitive impairment-no dementia (CIND)* and *45* had *dementia*. We used multiple linear regression to assess whether the interaction between years of education and each hippocampal volume significantly predicted the episodic- memory scores’ variance, *controlling* for cognitive *diagnosis* and nuisance variables. The interaction term with the left hippocampus (ß = 0.2, p = 0.043, CI = 1.0, 1.4), but not with the right (ß = 0.1, p = 0.218, CI = 0.9, 1.2) significantly predicted the variation on memory scores. The mechanism by which the left hippocampus seems to play a more important role on memory processing in more educated individuals needs to be further investigated and might be associated with a better use of mnemonic strategies or higher hippocampal connectivity. Because the sample’s median years of education was four, which corresponds to primary school, we may infer that this level might be sufficient to contribute for building cognitive reserve.

Preventive interventions are becoming relevant as useful strategies to contain the rising dementia rates, given the constant failures of disease-modifying trials targeting Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). Preventive interventions should target specific mechanisms and prioritize modifying known risk factors like low education, that accounts for 19% of the AD’s crude population attributable risk (Norton et al., 2014). To develop strategies that will harness education as a preventative tool, we need to better understand the protective mechanisms of education. Cognitive reserve, a framework created to study those mechanisms (Stern, 2016), has the educational attainment as one of its main components. Some proposed underlying mechanisms are the development of better cognitive abilities (Nitrini et al., 2005; Opdebeeck et al., 2016; Stern, 2016) and a lesser cognitive impairment than expected due to cerebrovascular lesions (Farfel et al., 2013; Vaque-Alcazar et al., 2016), hippocampal atrophy (Murray et al., 2011) and amyloid pathology (Roe et al., 2008; Wirth et al., 2014) by more educated individuals. Other mechanisms are related to building brain reserve, supported by studies showing that the higher the education the larger the brain volumes, more connectivity between brain regions, the lower rate of hippocampal atrophy (Arenaza-Urquijo et al., 2013; Persson et al., 2016) and the more efficient the brain activation during memory tests (Springer et al., 2005; Bartrés-Faz et al., 2009).

However, *most* studies investigating the mechanisms of education as a cognitive reserve component have been conducted *in high-income countries*. Nevertheless, more than 60% of people with dementia live in low -and middle-income countries where 22–88% of the older adults are illiterate (UNESCO, 2016). Therefore, unveiling mechanisms of cognitive reserve in low- educated individuals can inform about the contribution of even few years for building reserve. Considering that the hippocampi are key structures for episodic memory processing (Tulving, 2002; Sarazin et al., 2010) and that hippocampal dysfunction is a hallmark of AD (Dubois et al., 2010), we sought to look whether the years of formal education would moderate the relationship between hippocampal volumes and episodic-memory performance in a sample of older adults with a wide range of educational levels, from illiterate to college. We hypothesized that an increase in the number of years of education would lead to a stronger association between the hippocampal volumes and the episodic memory scores, suggesting a potential mechanism of cognitive reserve in the context of low educational attainment.

The participants (n = 183) came from *two studies* conducted in the *Southeast region of Brazil*, one from a *tertiary memory clinic* (n = 47) and other from the *community* (n = 136) (see Supplementary Data for details about the community-dwelling participants). There was not a minimum of years of education to be included in the study. All participants were examined by a team of experienced board-certified neurologists, geriatricians, and one psychiatrist and they were divided into three cognitive groups: cognitively- healthy, cognitive impairment-no dementia (CIND) and dementia. The cognitively-healthy participants were functionally independent and scored within expected by age and education in the Brief Cognitive Battery (BCB) (Nitrini et al., 2004). The participants in the dementia group were functionally dependent and met the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for dementia or major neurocognitive disorder (APA, 2013). The participants in the CIND group were functionally independent and performed lower than expected in the BCB test, therefore they all had objective cognitive impairment, most of them in the memory domain. Functional independence was defined as a score less than five in the Functional Activities Questionnaire (Pfeffer et al., 1982). The Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Minas Gerais approved both studies and all participants, or their legally authorized representatives provided written informed consent, according to the principles of the Helsinki declaration.

All participants underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination (*MMSE*) (Folstein et al., 1975; Brucki et al., 2003) and the *BCB*. The BCB is a *visual-verbal episodic memory test* that does not suffer the influence of the educational level (Nitrini et al., 2004). We used the *free delayed-recall* scores as surrogates of episodic memory because of their ability to discriminate patients with AD from CIND and cognitively-healthy (Nitrini et al., 2004; Yassuda et al., 2017). Details about the BCB test are found in Supplementary Data.

All participants’ scans were acquired in the same 3-Tesla Philips scanner. The 3D-T1 images were acquired in a sagittal plane (acquisition parameters in Supplementary Data) and were preprocessed in SPM-12, segmented into gray, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, warped in the study-created template and normalized to the Montreal Neurologic Institute space. Bilateral brain regions important for memory processing and often affected by Alzheimer’s disease (Karow et al., 2010) namely the hippocampi, the inferior parietal and supramarginal gyri, the posterior cingulate, the precuneus, the middle temporal, the inferior temporal, the entorhinal, the parahippocampal, the fusiform, and the middle frontal cortical regions were extracted automatically using the Neuromorphometric atlas (Desikan et al., 2006).所有参与者的扫描都是在同一台 3-Tesla Philips 扫描仪中获取的。 3D-T1 图像是在矢状面上采集的（补充数据中的采集参数），并在 SPM-12 中进行了预处理，分割成灰质、白质和脑脊液，在研究创建的模板中变形并归一化到蒙特利尔神经病学研究所 空间。 双侧大脑区域对记忆处理很重要并且经常受到阿尔茨海默氏病的影响（Karow 等人，2010 年），即海马体、下顶叶和缘上回、后扣带回、楔前叶、中颞叶、下颞叶、内嗅、 使用神经形态学图谱自动提取海马旁、梭形和中额叶皮层区域 (Desikan et al., 2006)。*White-matter lesions volumes* were automatically segmented and quantified using the Lesion Segmentation Tool version 1.2.2 in SPM8 (Schmidt et al., 2012; Birdsill et al., 2014) based on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (acquisition parameters in Supplementary Data).

Between-cognitive groups differences in demographics and clinical characteristics, that had non-normal distribution per Shapiro-Wilk, were compared using Kruskal-Wallis. Differences in the proportions of males were calculated with Chi-square. Differences in the hippocampal volumes adjusted for total intracranial volume (TIV), that had normal distribution per Shapiro-Wilk, were calculated using one-way ANOVA.

The associations between hippocampal volumes and episodic memory were calculated using univariate linear regression considering the episodic-memory scores as the outcome and each hippocampal volume (right and left) adjusting for TIV as separate predictors. Multiple linear regression models were *adjusted* for *age*, years of education, *gender*, the cognitive *diagnosis*, the MMSE, the BCB’s learning phase scores, the sum of the other brain regions extracted through the Neuromorphometric Atlas and the volume of white matter lesions. The moderator effect of years of education was tested by adding the interaction term (years of education × each hippocampal volume) as separate predictors in the multiple linear regression models. The level of significance was considered as p < 0.05 in two- tailed tests. The analyses were conducted in the software Rstudio, Version 1.1.414–©2009–2018.

## M. Joannette 2019. Education as a Moderator of the Relationship Between Episodic Memory and Amyloid Load in Normal Aging
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/6.%20Education%20as%20a%20moderator%20of%20the%20relationship%20between%20episodic%20memory%20and%20amyloid%20load%20in%20normal%20aging.pdf)
### Intro
The current study explored whether education, a proxy of cognitive reserve, modifies the association between *episodic memory (EM)* performance and βeta-amyloid load (*Aβ*), a biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease, in a cohort of *cognitively normal* older adults. *One hundred and four* participants (mean age 73.3 years) evenly spread out in three bands of education were recruited. Participants underwent neuropsychological assessment, structural MRI as well as PET imaging to quantify Aβ load. Moderation analyses and the *Johnson–Neyman technique* were carried out to examine the interaction of education with Aβ load to predict EM performance. Linear regressions were then performed within each group of education to better illustrate the interaction effect (all analyses were controlled for age and sex). The interaction between education and Aβ load was significant (p < .05) for years of education, reaching a *cutoff point of 13.5 years*, above which the relationship between Aβ load and EM was no longer significant. Similarly, significant associations were found between Aβ and EM among participants with secondary (p < .01) and pre-university education (p < .01), but not with a university degree (p = .253). EM performance is associated with Aβ load in cognitively normal older individuals, and this relationship is moderated by educational attainment.

The current state of the literature tends to demonstrate a subtle but significant impact of amyloid load (Aβ), one of the main Alzheimer’s disease (AD) changes, on neuropsychological performances of older adults in a period of life where cognition is still clinically normal (1,2). More specifically, a greater effect of Aβ is found in regard to episodic memory (EM) (3). AD is also characterized by a large and progressive deficit in verbal learning, which remains predominant throughout the disease course (4). EM decline is recognized as one of the first clinical signs of AD and thus the best cognitive predictor of future conversion to the disease (5,6).

Aβ begins to accumulate before the first clinical signs of AD and is associated with an increased risk for future cognitive decline (7,8). Although some older individuals have a significant amount of Aβ pathology, their cognitive performances are still within normal limits (9). The concept of cognitive reserve (CR) has thereby been proposed to account for the discrepancy between the level of brain pathologies, such as Aβ load, and expected clinical manifestations generally asso- ciated with it (10). Education is one of the most studied proxies of CR and has been widely recognized as a moderator of cognitive changes associated with an underlying pathology, such as AD ==**(11,12)**==. Indeed, this capacity to withstand brain damage is largely studied in cases of patients with AD to account for the fact that at equal level of cognitive performance, higher-educated patients present more aggregation of Aβ than less-educated patients (13). CR, as measured by level of education, is also known to moderate cognitive changes observed in normal aging ==*(10,14)*==. Older adults who benefits from a higher education tend to show a slower rate of cognitive decline over time compare to those with lower level of education (15).

Nevertheless, whether educational attainment may help withstand the effect of Aβ deposition on cognitive functioning among cognitively intact older adults is still unclear, more specifically regarding EM. For instance, in postmortem studies, EM performance was reported to be associated to the count of neuritic plaques in nondemented older participants, but this association was found to be weaker in higher-educated than in lower-educated individuals (16). In contrast, in vivo studies showed that education interacted with Aβ to predict ==global cognitive functioning (17)== but ==not EM (17–19)==. However, these previous studies were conducted, for the most part, with highly educated older individuals. This more restrictive sample regarding educational level of the general population may have masked the potential moderating effect of this latter proxy of CR. The nature of the relationship between EM, Aβ load and education in normal aging remains a question of great interest since this cognitive function seems particularly vulnerable to Aβ accumulation (2,3).

The present study takes place in the ongoing efforts to better characterize the preclinical phase of AD by examining potential reserve factors, such as educational attainment, that may contribute to differential neuropsychological performances associated with the underlying Aβ changes. Thus, the aim of the study was to determine whether education, a surrogate of CR, can moderate the effect of Aβ, as measured using in vivo PET imaging with 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) (20), on EM in normal aging. Furthermore, this question was investigated through the recruitment of an equivalent number of participants in three bands of education. Our main hypothesis was that the association between Aβ load and EM would be weaker among cognitively intact older individuals with higher education compared to their peers with lower education.

In this cross-sectional study, *104 cognitively normal older individuals* (aged 65 and older; mean age 73.3 years), without significant memory complaints nor significant cognitive impairment, that is, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, were recruited in this study. Exclusion criteria included a history of neurological and/or traumatic brain injury, psychiatric disorders including untreated past or current severe depression and anxiety, untreated illnesses that may cause cognitive impairment (eg, diabetes, metabolic or endocrine con- dition, etc.), alcohol or drug abuse during life, anesthesia in the last 6 months and uncorrected visual or hearing problems. Participants were recruited from a pool of participants at the Centre de recherche de l’Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal (CRIUGM) and through advertising. Cognitive testing and MRI imaging were performed at the CRIUGM and PET imaging at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). This study protocol was reviewed and approved by local research ethic boards. All participants provided written informed consent prior to their participation in the study.

The following screening procedure allowed to *confirm the absence of* significant memory complaints as well as cognitive impairment (*MCI or dementia*). The Conversations and Movies/Books subtests of the Self-Evaluation Questionnaire (21), which are associated with objective memory deficits in MCI (22), were administered (inclusion score> −2 SD). A visual recognition memory test (DMS-48, 2 min- utes delay (23)) and a verbal memory test (Logical Memory (24)) were used to screen for objective memory deficits (inclusion score > −1.5 SD on at least one of these tests). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (25) was also administered to all participants, in which a score of >23/30 is considered as an inclusion criterion (26). To exclude significant depressive symptomatology, participants had to score <11/30 on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (27).

A large body of evidence shows that delayed recall scores in EM tests are among the earliest cognitive changes observed in preclinical AD and are predictive of future conversion to AD (6). Thus, delayed recall scores were used to compute an *EM* measure. To ensure in- ternal validity of our EM composite score, we performed a correlational matrix between our measures of delayed recall. This analysis allowed to determine which of these measures best intercorrelated. *Delayed recalls* of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) (28) and *Logical Memory* (24) were selected based on a medium effect size correlation of r = .31 (p < .001) (29). The EM composite score was then computed by converting raw scores into z-scores based on the mean and standard deviations of the whole sample and *averaging the z-scores of those two memory tests*. The RAVLT was initially chosen over other word-list learning tests because it is free of a semantic learning context (ie, semantic categories). Indeed, the latter often results in ceiling effects in more educated individuals (30). Similarly, the sensitivity of the Logical Memory test shows a high level of accuracy in discriminating between cognitively healthy older individuals and those with very mild AD (31).

In addition, all participants underwent neuropsychological testing assessing a range of cognitive functions including processing speed, attention, working memory, executive functions, language/ semantics and visuospatial abilities. Global intellectual ability (IQ) was also assessed as part of the cognitive assessment (32).

*Educational achievement* was selected as a proxy of CR. Participants were evenly distributed into three groups based on their level of education: secondary school, CEGEP or its equivalent (a pre-university program in Quebec), and university, each level leading to a specific diploma in Quebec educational system. Participants with *secondary school* education had between *9 and 11 years* of education, participants with *pre-university* education had between *12 and 13 years* of education, whereas participants with a university *background* had *more than 13 years* of education. Participants *had to have a minimal number of 9 years of education*, in order to exclude potential confounding factors such as a history of neurodevelopmental disorder. There was no maximum number of years of education. In each group, however, a diploma did not necessarily have to be obtained for participants to be included. In addition to classifying participants into three bands of education, the number of years of formal educa- tion was also considered and examined as a continuous variable. The level of educational attainment and number of years of education were obtained via self-reported information.

All Positron Emission Tomography (*PET*) imaging occurred, on average, 85.12 days (SD = 73.26) following neuropsychological assessment. PET data were acquired with an ECAT HR+ scanner (Siemens/ CTI) in 3D imaging mode at the McConnell Brain Imaging Center of the MNI. The scanning session began 50 minutes prior to start of the actual scan during which time the *PiB* bolus was injected. After 50 minutes, during which time the participant rested comfortably, the participant was positioned in the scanner, and data acquisition was started, resulting in the acquisition of seven frames: 6× 300 seconds, and 1× 600 seconds. Each frame was comprised of 63 axial slices with an in-plane resolution of 2.06 × 2.06 mm. Total time required for the entire scanning session was 90 minutes. PET data were reconstructed using filtered back projection and were corrected for photon attenuation, scattering and radioactive decay. The *standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR)* was computed to quantitatively characterize the binding of the radioactive tracer PiB to amyloid during PET scanning. This ratio provides a quantifiable measure of Aβ accumulation in each participant’s brain, which was used as a continuous variable in all subsequent statistical analyses. The SUVR was determined by normalizing the radioactivity concentration of the whole cortex using average *gray matter of the cerebellum* as the reference tissue, since this region is known to be unaffected by Aβ deposition (20).

The MR images were acquired at the Unité de Neuroimagerie Fonctionnelle (UNF) located at the CRIUGM on a 3T Trio Siemens Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). High resolution anatomical im- ages included T1-weighted magnetization and were obtained using an optimized MPRAGE protocol (TR = 2.3 seconds, TE = 2.94 ms, TI = 900 ms, flip angle = 9°, FOV = 256 × 240, voxel 1 × 1 × 1.2 mm) using an eight-channel coil. This optimized MPRAGE protocol allowed the coregistration of PET to the MR image for each participant. The total acquisition time was approximately 30 minutes.

*One-tailed bivariate correlations* were performed to examine associations between age on the one hand, and Aβ load and EM performance on the other hand. Education and its associations with Aβ load, EM performance, and IQ were also explored. Similarly, a one-tailed bivariate correlation was carried out to verify the association between years of education and IQ. As for EM and education, a one-tailed partial correlation (controlled for age) was conducted. *A partial correlation* while controlling for age was used in order to assess the relationship between Aβ load and number of years of education. In fact, there are conflicting findings in the literature regarding the association between education and Aβ load. While some studies did not find a significant relationship between education and Aβ deposition (16,33,34), others have reported that greater cognitive engagement based on lifestyle factors, such as a higher level of education, is associated with a reduced level of Aβ load (35,36).

A stepwise multiple regression was performed to examine the independent associations of age, sex, and Aβ with EM composite score. This descriptive model was used to better understand the relationship between these variables and to determine which one is most strongly associated with EM performance.

Then, we performed a *moderation analysis* in which an interaction term was included (education × Aβ load) to assess whether Aβ load interacts differently with EM as a function of years of education. EM performance was introduced in the model as the dependent variable, Aβ load as the independent variable and the *moderator was the number of years of education*. *Age and sex* were included in the statistical model as *covariates*. This analysis allowed us to assess the effect of education when considered as a continuous variable (ie, number of years of education) and was performed using Model 1 in PROCESS macro 3.1 for SPSS (37). The Johnson–Neyman technique(37) was then applied in order to determine the regions of significance. This latter analysis identifies the values of the moderator (ie, number of years of education) for which the effect of Aβ load on EM transitions between being nonsignificant to statistically significant by probing the relationship between these two variables for all the possible values of the education variable.

In addition, in order to examine whether the moderation effect is solely due to education, IQ was added as a covariate in the moderation model. In a secondary set of analysis, we explored whether IQ could also moderate the relationship between performance in EM and Aβ load. Moderation analysis was carried out here as well with age and sex added to the model as covariates.

Then, to better illustrate the interaction effect, multiple regression analyses (stepwise) were performed for each group of education with age, sex, and Aβ load included in the models to determine which had an impact on EM performance. This analysis permitted the visualization of the relationship between Aβ load and EM performance as a function of educational attainment.

Effect sizes were computed for each main analysis using SPSS 25. For all tests, p < .05 was considered significant. Assumption criteria were met for all analysis performed in this study.
### Results
1. There was an interaction between the number of years of education and Aβ load to predict EM performance indicating the presence of a moderation effect; **F (1, 98) = 4.3995, p < .05, R2 = .0344** (Figure 1). 

	- Based on F statistics, ![[Pasted image 20230418101516.png]] we know p=0.039, then use F p to proximate t test p, calculate the t statistic and get the SE of beta. ![[Pasted image 20230418153201.png]]
2. *EM* performance was found to be associated solely with *Aβ load*, and not age or sex. The analysis revealed a significant regression equation (F (1, *102*) = 20.51, p < .001, R2 = .167)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230815115535.png|150]] p=0.00002, so based on p and N, the β=-0.445 ![[Pasted image 20230815120132.png|200]] 
3. EM was significantly and uniquely associated with the level of Aβ load in participants with secondary education (F (1, 32) = 10.59, p < .01, R2 = .249, β = *-0.499*) and in participants with pre-university education (F (1, 33) = 12.68, p < .01, R2 = .278, β = *-0.527*). As for the group of participants with university education, no association was found between EM and all three variables, ie, Aβ deposition, age, and sex (p > .05, β = *0.116*).
	- The effect of the averaged beta is -0.303

More specifically, with *each additional year of education, the effect of Aβ load on EM changed by 0.469 units*. This result suggests that the association between Aβ and EM is *stronger among those with lower education*. This interaction was further explored in order to determine the specific threshold (years of education) above which Aβ load does not influence EM anymore. Results show that the relationship between Aβ load and EM ceases to be significant at 13.5 years of education and above (Figure 2). Furthermore, since IQ is related to educational attainment, we further controlled for IQ in the model. *IQ* did *not influence* the *moderation effect of education* on the relationship between Aβ burden and EM described above. The interaction remained statistically significant when IQ was included in the model as a covariate and the effect size remained similar (F (1, 97) = 4.7619, p < .05, R2 = .0340). When a moderation analysis was carried out with IQ, and not education, as a moderator of the relationship between EM performance and Aβ load (age and sex included as covariates), the interaction did not reach significance (p = .648).

## LE. DuBose 2019. Education moderates the effects of large central artery aging on cognitive performance in middle-aged and older adults

### Intro
**Central artery aging**, *including* elevated *aortic stiffness*, central *blood pressure (BP)*, and *pulse pressure (PP)* (Pulse pressure is the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements. It is an important parameter in assessing cardiovascular health and can provide information about the elasticity of the arteries and the efficiency of the heart), is a novel risk factor for the development of age-associated cognitive dysfunction. Individuals with higher educational attainment may develop greater brain pathology prior to the onset of cognitive decline. However, whether education moderates relations between central artery aging and cognitive performance is unknown. We hypothesized that years of formal education would moderate the relation between central artery aging and cognitive performance in *middle-aged/ older (MA/O) adults* (n = 113, age 67.3 ± 0.7 years). Significant interactions between education* central systolic BP (β = .21, p = .02) and education* central PP (β = .22, p = .01) demonstrated weaker associations between central BP and PP with processing speed performance in those with higher education. Similarly, education moderated the relation between *aortic stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, cfPWV)* and executive function performance (β = .21, p = .02). To test if the relation between central arterial aging and cognitive performance was captured by a predetermined education threshold, MA/O adults were secondarily categorized as ≤high school (HS) (i.e., ≤12 years, n = 36) or >HS (≥13 years, n = 77). Higher central systolic BP was associated with slower processing speed (≤HS: r = −.59, p < .001 vs. >HS: r = −.25, p = .03) and weaker executive function (r = −.39, p = .03 vs. r = −.32, p = .006). Higher cfPWV was selectively correlated with weaker executive function performance (r = −.39, p = .03) in ≤HS only and this association significantly differed between education groups. Educational attainment appears to moderate the adverse effects of central artery aging on cognitive performance among MA/O adults.

Development of age-related cognitive decline is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States (Alzheimer’s Association, 2018). Healthcare costs associated with dementia are estimated to be 60% greater than costs related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer and are expected to rise as the prevalence of dementia surges from 5 million to 15 million by 2050. Increased attention has been directed at understanding the complex pathophysiology of cognitive decline and risk factors that contribute to or moder- ate the development of age-related cognitive decline in order to guide the prevention and treatment. In this regard, modifiable risk factors for the development of cognitive decline include CVD risk factors (Cooper et al., 2016; Geijselaers et al., 2016; Hanon et al., 2005) such as elevated blood pressure (BP), diabetes, and increased large central elastic artery stiffness, as well as sociobehavioral risk factors such as educational attainment (Hankey, 2018; Mortamais et al., 2014). However, the mechanism by which cognitive impairment manifests and progresses likely results from complex interactions between modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors across the lifespan. 然而，认知障碍表现和进展的机制可能源于整个生命周期中可修改和不可修改的风险因素之间复杂的相互作用。

Age-related stiffening of the large central arteries, including the aorta 主动脉 eɪˈɔːrtə and carotid 颈动脉 kəˈrɑːtɪd arteries, is a novel risk factor for the development of cognitive impairment (Hughes et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2011; Pase et al., 2016). Large central elastic artery stiffness is an independent predictor of longitudinal changes in cognitive performance (Scuteri et al., 2007) among middle-aged and older (MA/O) adults mediated in part through the development of neuropathology (Cooper et al., 2016). Stiffening of the aorta reduces the ability of the large central elastic arteries to buffer elevated central systolic BP and pulse pressure (PP) generated by left ventricular contraction and augmented by the earlier return of the backward reflected wave to the aorta. Elevated transmission of excessive pulsatile pressure and blood flow promotes the development of cerebral small vessel disease and cognitive dysfunction in aging (Mitchell et al., 2011; Rosano et al., 2013). Indeed, aortic stiffness, as measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), predicts declines in cognitive performance, independent of BP, suggesting that stiffness of the conduit arteries that transmit BP and supply blood flow to the brain may be more important than BP alone. Taken together, while these data support the contribution of central arterial hemodynamics to brain aging, these data also suggest that vascular aging represents only a portion of the complex pathophysiology by which cognitive decline and dementia manifest.

Importantly, the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment begins decades prior to the clinical manifestations of reductions in memory, learning, or thinking associated with dementia. However, certain protective behavioral factors may promote resiliency against the development of age-related neuropathological changes in the brain. Education is an important early life protective risk factor for reducing the dementia risk and delaying the onset of cognitive decline (Hankey, 2018). Education modulates age-related cognitive decline in part by increasing the cognitive reserve (CR) of the brain (Stern, 2002, 2009). While greater educational attainment does not prevent the development of neuropathology, education increases the “reserve” the brain may utilize to maintain or attenuate declines in cognitive performance (Stern, 2002, 2009). In this regard, an individual with higher educational attainment will be able to accumulate greater amounts of neuropathology (Brickman et al., 2011; Stern, Alexander, Prohovnik, & Mayeux, 1992) (e.g., white matter hyperintensities, β-amyloid deposition, reductions in cerebral blood flow) prior to the manifestation of cognitive decline compared with an individual with fewer years of formal education (Stern, 2002, 2009). Collectively, these studies demonstrate the importance of considering the moderating effects of edu- cation on the pathophysiology of cognitive decline. However, cross-sectional studies linking central artery aging and cognitive performance (Hughes et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2011; Pase et al., 2016; Scuteri et al., 2007; Tsao et al., 2013) commonly statistically adjust for years of formal education because education is a well-known correlate of cognitive performance (Elias, Elias, D'Agostino, Silbershatz, & Wolf, 1997). Despite the critical role of education on cognitive performance, the degree to which education moderates the relation between central artery aging and cognitive performance remains unexplored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree to which education moderates the association between central artery aging and cognitive performance. We hypothesized that (1) years of formal education would moderate the relation between central artery aging and cognitive performance; and (2) the relation between central artery aging and cognitive performance would be weaker in individuals with high compared with lower ed- ucational attainment in MA/O adults. Support for this would indicate that greater educational attainment may be protective against the adverse effects of central artery aging on cognitive performance.

MA/O adults between the ages of 55 and 85 years with and without atherosclerotic vascular disease (AVD) were recruited through the parent study “Aging, Vascular Disease and Cognition” (Grant number: NIA RO1AG030417-01A2, PI: David Moser, PhD) from the Iowa City, Iowa community, and the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics between the years 2008 and 2013. Participants were recruited through flyer and email advertisements to undergo vascular and cognitive testing. Participants were *free* of major *psychiatric or neurological disorders or head injury* resulting in loss of consciousness for greater than 30 min. Additionally, participants had no prior history of developmental disorders, systemic illnesses, or neurological disorders that could potentially affect cognition as indicated by detailed health history questionnaire. Female participants were postmenopausal and education groups did not differ by the number of women currently taking hormone replacement therapy during the visit. All participants provided written informed consent to all study protocols that were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Iowa and performed in accordance with ethical standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki.

If education-related benefits on cognitive performance increase linearly with each successive year of formal education or plateaus at a certain threshold of education remains unclear (Andel, Vigen, Mack, Clark, & Gatz, 2006; Koepsell et al., 2008; Tucker-Drob, Johnson, & Jones, 2009; Zahodne et al., 2011). To examine this, *education was evaluated as both a continuous and dichotomous variable*. First, education was used as a continuous variable to test the linear effects of increasing education on the relation between central artery aging and cognition. *Years of education (continuous variable) was standardized* as the completion of the highest grade or degree of obtainment. Second, education was categorized as ≤HS (i.e., ≤12 years of formal education: HS diploma or less; n = 36) or >HS (i.e., ≥13 years of formal education: at least one year of college or greater; n = 77) years of education to test the effects of obtaining a certain threshold of formal education. The cutoff of 12 years (i.e., HS diploma) of formal education was determined a priori based on prior literature (Hankey et al., 2018) showing this to be associated with reduced risk of cognitive dysfunction and the hypothesis that this level of educational attainment (i.e., HS diploma) may be more contemporarily relevant provided the high rate (approximately 90%) of HS degree completion in adults over the age of 25 years in the state of Iowa.

Participants reported to the laboratory following an overnight (>8 hr) fasting, having refrained from strenuous physical activity for at least 24 hr prior, and were instructed to hold all vasoactive血管活性的 medication on the morning of vascular testing. After 10 min of supine rest, aortic stiffness and central BP were measured using noninvasive applanation tonometry by *pulse wave velocity (PWV)* and pulse wave analysis (PWA) (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Inc.). Carotid and femoral pressure waveforms were collected using a noninvasive pressure tonometer. Pressure waveforms were gated to the R-wave of the ECG to calculate the change in time between the diastolic foot of the pressure waves. The distance between the carotid and femoral pulse sites was measured as the distance between the suprasternal notch (SSN) and the carotid pulse site minus the distance between SSN to the femoral pulse site to account for parallel transmission. *cfPWV* was calculated as the *corrected distance* divided by the carotid and femoral foot-to-foot delay. Central BP, rather than brachial, was selected a priori because central BP may more closely repre- sent the BP the brain is exposed to compared with brachial BP. Central BP and PP was determined from a radial artery pressure waveform via applanation tonometry and application of a validated transfer function in all participants (Kalil et al., 2016; Pierce et al., 2012). cfPWV and PWA records were collected in triplicate. Records of PWA with an opera- tor index >80% were averaged, consistent with the manufac- turer quality control recommendations. Participants (n = 6) without at least two records of an operator index <80% were excluded from analyses. Triplicate cfPWV data were averaged. If one value did not meet manufacturer criterion for low variability (<10% of pulse transit time SD), then that cfPWV value was omitted and duplicate data were averaged.

All participants completed cognitive testing administered by a trained research assistant under the supervision of a board-certified clinical neuropsychologist to assess *global cognitive*, *processing speed*, and *executive function* performance. Global cognitive performance was quantified as the Total Scale Score on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (*RBANS*) (Moser et al., 2012). *Processing speed and executive function* were *selected* a priori *based* on *literature* demonstrating that these domains of cognition are sensitive to the effects of age-related increases in large central artery stiffness and BP (Elias et al., 2009; Hajjar, Goldstein, Martin, & Quyyumi, 2016; Mitchell et al., 2011; Poels et al., 2007; Watson et al., 2011). Processing speed and **executive function performance were measured** by the *Stroop Color Word Reading Test* as previously described (Hoth, Poppas, Moser, Paul, & Cohen, 2008). Briefly, participants completed the maximal number of correct items (reading words or naming colors) in 45 s from a paper card held by the participant as a measure of processing speed. To minimize multiple comparisons, a *composite Z-score* was calculated for the *processing speed* domain. **Stroop interference**, which involves discriminating a name of a color from the color the word it is written in, was used to **quantify executive function performance**. *Higher scores* indicate *better* performance on all *cognitive* tests.

All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS 25.0 software (IBM, Inc.). Two-tailed Student *t tests* were used to test group differences in subject, vascular and cognitive performance variables. *First*, multiple linear *regression* models were used to test the moderating linear effect of education on the relation between the vascular aging variables and cognitive performance in the entire group. *Separate* linear regression models were tested by first entering the independent predictors (central artery aging variables, age, mean arterial pressure (MAP) [cfPWV only], sex, education [continuous variable], and antihypertensive medication use) of *each cognitive domain* (global cognitive performance, processing speed Z-score, and executive function) followed by the relevant education X central artery aging interaction term. An interaction term was calculated by centering each variable of interest (i.e., education [continuous variable], cfPWV, central systolic BP, and central PP) around their mean and then multiplying the *centered education* variable by the *centered vascular variable* of interest. The assumption of homoscedasticity was tested in all regression models by visual inspection of scatterplots produced by plotting the regression standardized values versus the regression studentized residuals. There was homoscedasticity in all models.

To test the *secondary* hypothesis that the relation between central artery aging and cognitive performance would be stronger in those with ≤HS compared with >HS, partial correlations between variables of interest and cognitive performance (adjusted for age, sex, and antihypertensive medication use) were calculated in the *>HS and ≤HS* groups, separately. Normality was tested using Shapiro–Wilk statistics in all variables included in the present analyses. *Central systolic BP, central PP, and cfPWV* were *square root transformed* to normalize the distribution of these variables in the sample. Partial correlations were tested using the normalized variables. *Vascular variables* of interest that were significantly *associated* with subdomains of *cognitive* performance from the partial correlations were entered into the linear regression models to *test* the *interaction* between vascular variables of interest and education (categorical variable) in the entire cohort. Separate linear regression models were tested by first entering the independent predictors of each cognitive domain followed by the interaction term. An interaction term was calculated by *centering each central artery aging* variable of interest around their mean and then multiplying the categorical education variable by the centered vascular variable of interest. Finally, all data are presented as mean ± SE and statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed alpha level of <.05.

One hundred and thirteen MA/O adults completed the study. Participant characteristics are displayed in Table 1. Importantly, the groups did not differ by any CVD risk factors, AVD status, or the use of antihypertensive medication or hormone replacement therapy (Table 1, all p > 0.05). Finally, cfPWV (p = .75), central systolic BP (p = .80), and central PP (p = .16) were similar between the education groups (Table 1). Mean cognitive performance data are also presented in Table 1. Global cognitive performance on the RBANS task was weaker in the ≤HS compared with >HS group (p < .001). The composite processing speed Z-score (p = .11) did not differ between education groups. However, reading speed was slower on the Stroop Word Reading (p = <.001) but not the Stroop Color Naming task (p = .13) in the ≤ HS com- pared with >HS group. Executive function performance on the Stroop Interference trial did not differ between the educa- tion groups (p = .28).

Tables 2‒4 displays the results of multiple linear regression models calculated to test the interaction between education and vascular variables of interest on global cognitive, pro- cessing speed, and executive function performance in sepa- rate models. Education (β = .24, p = .006) and central systolic BP (β = −.26, p = .007) were associated with processing speed performance in the entire cohort. Education moderated the effect of central systolic BP (education* central systolic BP β = .21, p = .02) (Table 2). Additionally, the interaction between education* and central PP was significantly associ- ated with processing speed performance (β = .22, p = .01) when added into the model with education (β = .24, p = .009) and central PP (β = −.20, p = .048, Table 3). These data indicate that with increasing years of educational attainment, the negative effect of central systolic BP or PP are attenuated on processing speed performance. Finally, the interaction between education and cfPWV was only marginally associated with processing speed performance (p = .09) in the entire cohort (Table S1a).

In a separate regression model calculated for executive function performance, education* cfPWV was selectively associated with executive function performance (β = .21, p = .02), while the main effects of MAP (β = −.27, p = .005) but not education (β = .16, p = .07) or cfPWV (β = −.03, p = .75) were associated with executive func- tion alone (Table 4). Consistent with this, the main effects of elevated central systolic BP (β = −.29, p = .003, Table S1b) and central PP (β = −.22, p = .03, Table S1c) were independently associated with executive function perfor- mance. However, education did not moderate BP or PP in any of these models (Table S1a and b) in the present co- hort. Finally, global cognitive performance was not asso- ciated with central systolic BP, central PP, or cfPWV nor were their interactions with education statistically signifi- cant (data not shown).

Partial correlations adjusted for age, sex, antihypertensive medication use and MAP (cfPWV only) were performed separately in the ≤HS and >HS groups (Table 5). Greater cfPWV was associated with weaker executive function per- formance in the ≤HS group (r = −.39, p = .03), but not in the >HS group (r = .15, p = .21) (Table 5). Central systolic BP was correlated with processing speed performance in both groups. However, this association was attenuated in the >HS group (r = −.25, p = .03) compared with ≤HS group (r = −.59, p < .001). Similarly, higher central systolic BP was associated with weaker executive function performance in the ≤HS (r = −.39, p = .03) and >HS (r = −.32, p = .006) groups. Greater central PP was selectively associated with slower processing speed (r = −.62, p < .001) in the ≤HS group only. However, the magnitude of the partial correlations did not differ between education groups (Table S2a and b) as evidenced by the nonsignificant interaction terms ex- cept in the domain of executive function. In this domain, the relation between cfPWV and executive function performance was significantly attenuated in the group with >HS compared with ≤HS independent of MAP (Table 6). Finally, global cognitive performance was not correlated with any vascular variables of interest in either group.

### Discussion
The primary objective of this study was to determine the de- gree to which education moderates the relation between cen- tral artery aging and cognitive performance in MA/O adults. To determine this, education was treated as a continuous and dichotomous variable to test the linear and threshold effects of years of formal educational completion, respectively. We demonstrated that the main effects of central artery aging, including central systolic BP and PP, but not cfPWV, were associated with lower performance on processing speed and executive function performance in the present cohort. Second, education, defined as a continuous variable, significantly at- tenuated the association between central artery aging and cog- nitive performance. Third, the relation between cfPWV and executive function was attenuated in individuals with >HS compared with ≤HS in this study. In contrast, higher central systolic BP and PP were associated with slower processing speed and weaker executive function performance in MA/O adults with ≤HS and >HS groups. However, these effects (i.e., correlational coefficients) did not differ between educa- tion groups as demonstrated by the nonsignificant interaction terms in the >HS versus ≤HS groups. Taken together, these data support our hypothesis that education moderates the ad- verse effects of central artery aging on cognitive performance in MA/O adults.

Increasing evidence supports the contribution of age-re- lated changes in the large central artery stiffness-related he- modynamics and central BP in the complex pathophysiology of cognitive decline (Mitchell et al., 2011; Pase et al., 2016; Scuteri et al., 2007). Stiffening of the large central arteries reduces the mismatch in the impedance gradient between the low (i.e., central elastic) and the high impedance (i.e., pe- ripheral muscular) arteries (Mitchell et al., 2011). Increased impedance matching augments the transmission of elevated pulsatile energy and blood flow to the vulnerable high flow, low impedance cerebral microvasculature. Chronic trans- mission of elevated pulsatile pressure and blood flow are hypothesized to promote cerebrovascular remodeling and augmented cerebrovascular resistance to limit the penetra- tion of excessive pressure to the downstream neurovascular units (Mitchell et al., 2011; Tarumi et al., 2014). However, remodeling of the cerebrovasculature occurs at the expense of cerebral blood flow regulation (DuBose et al., 2018; Jefferson et al., 2018), thereby increasing the susceptibility of the cerebral microstructure to hypoperfusion (Tarumi et al., 2014; Tarumi, Shah, Tanaka, & Haley, 2011). Indeed, ele- vated aortic stiffness, central BP, and PP are independent risk factors for the development of cerebral small vessel disease (Rosano et al., 2013; Shrestha et al., 2009; Webb et al., 2012) with one standard deviation increase in cfPWV, equivalent to 1.2 years of brain aging 35 and approximately 60%–70% increased risk for subcortical infarcts (Mitchell et al., 2011) in MA/O adults with CVD risk factors. In the present study, education defined as a continuous but not dichotomous vari- able, significantly moderated the relation between central systolic BP and PP on processing speed. Processing speed is the initial domain of cognition to decline with advancing age and is hypothesized to mediate reductions in subsequent domains of cognitive performance including executive func- tion (Salthouse, 1992). Therefore, it is possible that greater educational attainment may attenuate the detrimental effects of BP and PP on processing speed and subsequently slow- ing declines in other domains of cognition. However, in the present study, both threshold (>HS) and continuous effects of education on the relation between cfPWV and executive function were detected despite the lack of group differences in cfPWV and executive function performance. These data support prior studies that demonstrate the detrimental effects of age-related increases in aortic stiffness are strongest on do- mains of cognition associated with subcortical white matter including executive functioning in MA/O adults (Mitchell et al., 2011). Furthermore, these data extend prior findings by demonstrating that education moderates this relation partic- ularly in individuals with more years of education by weak- ening the relation between cfPWV and executive function performance. Taken together, these data suggest that educa- tion may not only be an important covariate of cognitive per- formance but also a critical moderator of the effects of central artery aging on cognition.

Numerous studies demonstrate that greater educational attainment is protective against age-related cognitive decline by increasing the “reserve” the brain may utilize to main- tain or attenuate changes in cognition (Gordon et al., 2008; Hankey, 2018; Stern, 2012; Stern et al., 1992). In this re- gard, greater educational attainment may be protective by increasing the brain's CR. CR is defined as an active process developed from experiential resources, such as education or occupational complexity. CR enables the brain to cope with the development of neuropathology to maintain or attenuate declines in brain function and cognitive performance using preexisting cognitive processing or by recruiting compen- satory neural pathways (Stern, 2012). The CR hypothesis was initially proposed to explain discrepancies between a brain's neuropathological load and observed cognition. In support of this, Stern et al., (1992) previously demonstrated that individuals with the greatest educational attainment had greater volumes of white matter lesions and reductions in basal temporal-parietal cerebral blood flow, despite being matched for clinical Alzheimer’s disease severity. Therefore, in individuals with greater educational attainment, age-re- lated decline will be slower until the threshold for neuropa- thology sufficient to induce cognitive dysfunction is reached, at which point, the rate of decline will be greater in those with high CR (Andel et al., 2006). This suggests that greater ed- ucational attainment may not prevent cognitive impairment or dementia, but rather may be associated with an increased overall quality of life by reducing the number of years an individual is impaired.

The precise mechanism by which education moderates cognitive performance with aging remains unclear. Greater educational attainment is hypothesized to increase the number of neural connections (i.e., neural reserve) or provide more alternate neural pathways that may be used if primary neural pathways become damaged (i.e., neural compensation) (Stern, 2012). However, greater educational attainment may also alter memory encoding processes in the brain leading to “richer” memories being formed or enhanced memory retrieval asso- ciated with optimal organizational structure or reconstruction of stored memories (Salthouse, 2003). While it remains un- clear the primary mechanism by which education moderates the relation between neuropathology and cognition, these hypotheses support the idea that the brain actively attempts to cope with the development of neuropathology to delay or attenuate cognitive decline and impairment in aging. It is pos- sible that the effects of aortic stiffness and central BP components on cognition demonstrated in the present study are mediated in part by the development of cerebral small vessel disease (Abraham et al., 2016; Aribisala et al., 2014; Dufouil et al., 2001) and attenuated by greater educational attainment. Furthermore, education moderates the effects of cerebral white matter lesions on cognition (Mortamais et al., 2014). Results of the present study support this hypothesis by demonstrating that the effects of vascular aging, including central systolic BP and PP, had a stronger negative association on cognition in individuals with fewer years of education. Taken together, the present study adds to the current body of knowledge that edu- cation may moderate the effects of vascular aging on cognitive performance in MA/O adults and therefore should be at least considered as a moderator in future studies.

This study should be interpreted in the context of sev- eral limitations. First, this study did not assess alternative moderators (i.e., occupational complexity, leisure time ac- tivities or physical activity) of CR (Stern, Albert, Tang, & Tsai, 1999; Stern et al., 1994). This is important because education is primarily achieved in the first several decades of life and ending before midlife, an important “sensitive” period for vascular aging. Therefore, the degree of occu- pational complexity or cognitively stimulating leisure time activities including physical activity or reading frequency (Sörman, Ljungberg, & Reading, 2018) also may be mod- erators of CR on cognitive aging because they occur with greater frequency during midlife compared with education. Prior studies have indicated that higher levels of educational attainment, occupational complexity, and physical activity may reduce the risk of cognitive impairment by 46% (Chan et al., 2018). Second, education treated as a continuous and dichotomous variable was defined as individuals who had completed 12 years or less of formal education. This thresh- old was selected based on data in which 92% of individuals over the age of 25 have received at least a HS level diploma in the state of Iowa. The educational threshold sufficient for being cognitively protective is unclear with some groups de- fining educational attainment by more conservative cutoffs of <8 years of formal education (Stern et al., 1999; Zahodne, Stern, & Manly, 2015) or contemporarily relevant criterion of <12 years (Andel et al., 2006; Zahodne et al., 2011) simi- lar to the present study. However, it is important to note that differences in average global cognitive performance and the relation between vascular risk factors and cognitive perfor- mance were detectable in the present study with the groups being separated by attainment of a HS diploma. These cutoffs may be more relevant in developed countries because approx- imately 84% of American students complete a HS diploma (NCES, 2017). Third, socioeconomic status (SES) was not measured in the present study and may influence educational attainment, cardiovascular health and cognition (Climie et al., 2019; Greenfield & Moorman, 2018). Recent data indi- cate that SES, both at the individual and neighborhood level, is associated with increased central artery stiffness in MA/O adults (Climie et al., 2019). Therefore, we cannot determine whether education, measured in the present study, is a sur- rogate for individual SES or if the effects of education on cognition demonstrated in the present study are independent of SES. Fourth, the current study did not measure functional connectively or white matter microstructure to test the mech- anism by which education moderated the effects of vascular aging on cognitive performance. Future studies should be conducted to explore neural compensation and neural re- serve as potential mechanisms by which education moder- ates the vascular contribution to cognitive aging. Fifth, the SphygmoCor device derives central aortic BP by calibrating the radial waveform to the brachial systolic and diastolic BP measured by oscillometric BP cuff. A recent meta-analysis indicates that this calibration method underestimates central BPs to a greater extent compared with the standard method (−7.8 vs. 3.0 mmHg) which uses the mean and diastolic BP. Therefore, while the reported central BP values may underes- timate actual central BP values, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the role of education on central BP across a con- tinuous range of central BPs rather than a dichotomous BP value. Finally, the cross-sectional design of this study does not allow for the determination of causality between educa- tion and cognitive function.

In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that ef- fects of central artery aging, including central systolic BP, PP and aortic stiffness, on processing speed and executive func- tion performance are attenuated in individuals with greater education attainment. These data suggest that education is an important moderator of the degree to which age-related central artery aging, including elevated central systolic BP and PP, impact cognitive performance. In this regard, MA/O adults with fewer years of education may be more sensitive to the detrimental effects of age-related increases in central systolic BP, PP and aortic stiffness on cognitive performance. However, further studies are needed to explore the degree to which other moderators of CR, such as occupational com- plexity, attenuate the relation between vascular aging and cognitive performance in aging.




## S. Walter 2019. Neuropsychological Test Performance and MRI Markers of Dementia Risk Reducing Education Bias

### Intro
To use neuropsychological assessments for studying the underlying disease processes contributing to dementia, it is crucial that they correspond to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)- based measures of dementia, regardless of educational level. French **3-City Dijon MRI study** cohort members (n=1782) with assessments of *white matter lesion volume (WMLV)*, *hippocampal volume (HCV)*, and *cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSFV)*, and 6 waves of neuropsychological assessments over 11 years, including Mini-Mental State Examination (*MMSE*), plus *5 other tests combined using a Z-score* or *item-response theory (IRT-cognition)* comprised the study cohort. We evaluated, testing interactions, whether education *modified* associations of MRI markers with *intercept* or *rate of change* of MMSE, Z-score composite, or IRT-cognition.

Results: In linear models, education modified the associations of WMLV and CSFV with MMSE and CSFV and Z-score composite. In mixed models, education modified the associations of WMLV and CSFV with level of MMSE and the association of HCV with slope of MMSE. Education also modified the association with CSFV and slope of Z-score composite decline. There was no evidence that education modified associations between MRI meas- ures and level or slope of IRT-cognition. Longitudinal analysis of correctly scaled neuropsychological assessments may provide unbiased proxies for MRI-based measures of dementia risk.

Neuropsychological tests offer noninvasive and inexpensive methods to detect elevated dementia risk. Exclusive reliance on biomarker-based measures of Alzheimer disease, the most frequent cause of dementia, is likely to reduce the diversity and size of human studies of the etiology of Alzheimer disease and dementia. Analytic approaches to enhance the validity of noninvasive assessments of disease progression, for example, neuropsychological assessments, are critical. Because both progressive biological disease processes and cognitive or brain reserve contribute to dementia diagnoses, it is important to evaluate risk factors for both. Brief neuropsychological assessments and screening tools, such as the Mini Mental State Examination (*MMSE*), may provide *valuable* tools for research *if* these neuropsychological measures *correspond* with *underlying* progressive *pathological processes* similarly across populations of different educational backgrounds. Prior research suggests, however, that education modifies the associations between some neuropsychological tests and pathological burden. If a 1-point difference in neuropsychological test performance does not equate to the same magnitude of difference in underlying disease progression for a high or low education individuals, the measure will be a biased tool for assessing this underlying pathology (Figure 1). Similarly, such a bias will compromise etiologic research on any putative risk factor that is correlated with education. We *hypothesized* that with optimal neuropsychological measurement and modeling, the correspondence between *neuroimaging markers* of dementia risk *and neuropsychological assessments* would be *equivalent regardless of education*. We examined the relationships of MRI-based biomarkers of brain health with level and change in neuropsychological tests characterized using a single measure (MMSE score), a Z-score composite measure of 4 tests, and an item-response-theory based composite measure (IRT-Cognition).

The 3 City (3C) Dijon study is a population-based cohort of 4,931 French noninstitutionalized individuals (Three-City Study, 2003). A total of 2,763 individuals aged < 80 years were invited to undergo brain MRI between June 1999 and September 2000. Consent rate was high (83%, 2,285 individuals) but because of financial restrictions, only 1,923 MRI scans were performed. Valid MRI measures for all exposure variables were available for 1,782 participants aged between 65 to 80 years. On average these 1,782 participants were 1.5 years younger, scored higher on all cognitive tests, and were better educated than the entire 3C sample. For example, 46% of MRI participants completed up to upper primary school (8 years or less), while 58% of the full sample completed up to upper primary school. The cognitive status of all participants was assessed up to 6 times over 11 years of follow-up. MRIs were completed at baseline. The 3C study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Kremlin-Bicêtre University Medical Center, Paris, France. All participants gave their written, informed consent to participation.

MRI acquisition details have been previously reported. White Matter Lesion Volume (WMLV) was estimated from neuroimaging data with an automatic image processing method and Hippocampal Volume (HCV) and Cerebral Spinal Fluid Volume (CSFV) were estimated with voxel-based morphometry. We normalized CSFV, HCV, and WMLV by residualizing against Intracranial Volume (ICV) and rescaling to the standard normal distribution. To simplify comparisons, we use *Z-score transformed versions* of the **MRI measures**.

**Education** was assessed in 3C as an ordinal variable and *dichotomized at the median* (upper primary school (8 years] or less versus more than 8 years).

At each wave, **cognitive testing** included the MMSE, Benton visual recognition test, Trail Making Tests A and B, and verbal fluency (Isaacs Set Test). The MMSE is a screening test that assesses global cognition (working memory, language and praxis, orientation, memory, and attention). Despite the documented limitations of the MMSE, we used this as a reference test because MMSE or variants are extremely common tools for assessing dementia risk in epidemiological research studies. The *Benton Visual Retention Test* assesses *nonverbal memory* and is associated with construction and design copying tasks; the *Trail Making Tests* assess attention, visuomotor tracking and speed, divided attention, and cognitive flexibility, and the *Isaacs Set Test* reflects both literacy and the ability to organize thinking by clustering words from cities, fruits, vegetables, and colors. We evaluated associations between MRI measures and three cognitive measures. To place all 3 cognitive outcomes on the same scale, we *Z-score* transformed MMSE using its baseline mean and standard deviation. We also created *Z-score composite* and *IRT-based composite* measures of *cognition*. To create the Z-score composite, *each measure (including MMSE)* was first Z-score transformed using its baseline mean and standard deviation. We then *averaged the Z-scores* for the 6 instruments and rescaled to a standard normal distribution in the analytic sample.

To estimate the IRT-Cognition measures for each participant, we used confirmatory factor analysis as implemented in the lavaan R package (R Version 3.2.3) to estimate a two-parameter IRT model at each assessment wave. The model assumes a continuous underlying latent variable (general cognition) and *performance on any specific cognitive test (item)* reflects the influence of the latent variable and item-specific residuals. The two-parameter IRT model can be written for each item as a cumulative normal probability function with an item-specific intercept (to distinguish simple from difficult items) and a slope parameter that describes the influence of the underlying latent variable on the probability of successfully answering that item. Following the approach described by Gross et al., the continuous cognitive assessment scores for each test were subdivided into up to 5 categories of approximately equal sample size and treated as ordinal endogenous variables for the estimation model. The latent IRT-Cognition (general cognition) measure was set to have unit variance at baseline. In addition, we constrained factor loadings and test thresholds to be the same across visits while freeing subsequent means and variances of the latent variables at each study visit after baseline. Change in cognitive performance over the course of follow-up is thus reflected in the levels of the predicted latent variable at each study visit. Missingness in single variable responses was addressed using multiple imputation (with 10 imputed data sets) under the missing at random assumption, such that diagonally weighted least squares (WLSMV) estimation on complete data could be used in the estimation of the IRT model. The final IRT-Cognition measure was scaled to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 at baseline in the analytic sample.

Next, we evaluated whether education modified the associations of WMLV, HCV, and CSFV (*all residualized against ICV*) in linear regression models predicting baseline cognitive scores. These models were *adjusted* for *age* at first cognitive assessment and *sex*, and included education, one MRI measure, and the interaction of education and the MRI measure as predictors. We estimated *nine linear regression* models: one for each of the three MRI measures, for each cognitive outcome (MMSE, Z-score, and IRT-Cognition). We *next* used linear age and sex adjusted *growth curve models* with individual-level random intercepts and slopes to compare whether the associations of each MRI measure with either baseline (intercept) or rate of change (slope) in the cognitive outcomes (MMSE, Z-score, or IRT-Cognition) were modified by education. We centered follow-up time in these models at 3.5 years, to avoid estimating intercepts at the extremes of follow-up. Effect modification was tested with an interaction term between education and each MRI measure.

To express the magnitude of effect modification (potential education bias) in meaningful terms, we used *100 times* the *ratio* of the *interaction term* to the *main effect of the MRI measure.* If the MRI and neuropsychological assessment had equivalent correspondence for low and high education individuals, this ratio would be zero; a value of 100 indicates that the effect modification (interaction) in one education group is as large as the main effect in the other education group. To avoid over-interpreting trivially small biases that met statistical significance criteria or ignoring large biases that were imprecisely estimated, we *defined* evidence of *clinically important* potential bias as an interaction-to-main effect *ratio of 25% or greater* and applied a *p-value* threshold of *0.10* on the interaction term in the growth curve models. We use a higher p-value criterion than the conventional p<.05 because when evaluating bias, the risk of type 2 error (failing to detect an association) seems more important than the risk of type 1 error (incorrectly inferring an association).

To illustrate the effect of interaction bias, we extracted coefficients from the growth curve models and depicted the trajectory of (a) the predicted neuropsychological test score as a function of the MRI biomarker for low and high education individuals, based on models with or without the MRI biomarker by education interaction and (b) the predicted trajectory from age 75 to 85 if a sudden 1 standard deviation (SD) shift in the MRI biomarker occurs at age 80, for high and low education individuals, again based on models with or without an MRI biomarker by education interaction. All analyses report two-sided tests and 95% confidence intervals.

## C. Lin 2020. Cognitive Reserve Moderates Effects of White Matter Hyperintensity on Depressive Symptoms and Cognitive Function in Late-Life Depression (2020)

### Intro
Introduction: *White matter hyperintensity (WMH)* has been regarded as one of the major contributor of the vascular hypothesis of *late-life depression (LLD)* and *cognitive decline* in the elderly. On the other hand, cognitive reserve (CR) has long been hypothesized to provide resilience and adaptability against age- and disease-related insults. This study examined the role of CR, using proxy of education, in moderating the association between *WMH and clinical LLD* expression. Methods: A total of *54 elderly diagnosed with major depressive disorder* and *38 matched healthy controls* participated in this study. They received MRI scanning and a battery of neuropsychological tests. WMH was quantified by an automated segmentation algorithm. *Linear regression analyses* were conducted separately in the LLD and control groups to examine the effects of WMH, education and their *interaction* in depression severity and various *cognitive* domains. Results: WMH was significantly and negatively associated with executive function only in the healthy controls. In patients with LLD, we observed a significant interactive effect in education on the association between WMH and depression severity and language domain (category fluency task). Specifically, those with high education showed less depressive symptoms and cognitive decline as WMH increased. Conclusion: WMH is associated with lower cognitive function. However, in patients with LLD, high education attenuates the deleterious effect of WMH on mood and cognition. 白质高强度(White matter hyperintensity, WMH)被认为是血管假说晚年抑郁症(vascular hypothesis of late life depression, LLD)和老年人认知能力下降的主要原因之一。另一方面，认知储备(CR)长期以来一直被假设为提供弹性和适应能力，以应对年龄和疾病相关的侮辱。本研究采用教育程度作为代用指标，考察了CR在调节WMH和临床LLD表达之间的关系中的作用。方法:54例诊断为重度抑郁症的老年人和38例相匹配的健康对照组参与了这项研究。他们接受了核磁共振扫描和一系列神经心理测试。利用自动分割算法对WMH进行量化。在LLD组和对照组中分别进行了线性回归分析，以检验WMH、教育及其相互作用对抑郁症严重程度和各种认知领域的影响。结果:WMH仅在健康对照组与执行功能呈显著负相关。在LLD患者中，我们观察到教育在WMH、抑郁严重程度和语言领域(类别流利性任务)之间存在显著的交互作用。具体来说，随着WMH的增加，那些受过高等教育的人表现出较少的抑郁症状和认知能力下降。结论:WMH与认知功能低下有关。然而，在LLD患者中，高等教育可以减轻WMH对情绪和认知的有害影响。

Late-life depression (LLD) is a common psychiatric disorder associated with disability, decreased mental well-being, and completed suicides in the elderly (1). On the contrary to mildlife depression, *LLD* is substantially *attributed to* aging *process* and *cerebrovascular* changes (2). Such characteristics have given rise to the formation of the “vascular depression” hypothesis, which states that cerebrovascular factors predispose, precipitate, or perpetuate the geriatric depressive syndromes (3). Since the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuroimaging-defined vascular changes, particularly the white matter hyperintensities (WMH), have provided ample evidence in support of the vascular hypothesis of LLD (2, 4). Pathologically, WMH is caused by demyelination, gliosis, and axonal loss in the periventricular or deep white matter (5). Clinically, WMH occurs with normal aging, and is associated with increased risk of subsequent stroke, dementia, and death (6). Importantly, a fourth-fold increase in the prevalence of having WMH was found in late-onset compared with earlyonset LLD (7). It is hypothesized that WMH strategically disrupts the communication between cortical and subcortical regions, causing the frontolimbic compromise, and gives rise to affective and cognitive symptoms in LLD (2). Frontolimbic dysfunction was evidenced by the heightened limbic affective reactivity in depressed elderly patients with high WMH loading (8). Moreover, WMH was associated with cognitive impairment in LLD (9). Although WMH could predict poor antidepressant response in LLD, its predictive power was out-performed by the baseline cognitive function (10). However, some studies have failed to find an association between high WMH and poor antidepressant response (11, 12). Therefore, other factors should be considered when assessing the impact of WMH on depression and cognitive function in LLD. 病理上，WMH是由脑室周围或深部白质的脱髓鞘、胶质细胞增生和轴索缺失引起的(5)。临床上，WMH发生在正常老化时，并与随后中风、痴呆和死亡的风险增加相关(6)。重要的是，与早发性LLD相比，晚发性WMH的患病率增加了四倍(7)。我们假设WMH战略性地破坏了皮层和皮层下区域之间的通信，导致额叶边缘妥协，并且在LLD中引起情感和认知症状(2)。高WMH负荷的老年抑郁症患者的边缘情感反应性增强证明了额叶边缘功能障碍(8)。此外，WMH与LLD中的认知障碍相关(9)。它的预测能力被基线认知功能所超越(10)。然而，一些研究未能发现高WMH和抗抑郁药物不良反应之间的联系(11,12)。因此，在评估WMH对LLD患者抑郁和认知功能的影响时，需要考虑其他因素。

Cognitive reserve (CR) is the notion encompassing the active process of efficient utilization of brain networks in an effort to sustain normal functions despite brain insults (13, 14). Indicated by education, occupational attainment, or leisure activities, CR could reduce or delay the occurrence ofdementia (15). Similarly, CR may reduce cognitive decline in LLD by ameliorating the detrimental effects incurred by cerebrovascular diseases and hippocampal atrophy (16). In a large population-based cohort, CR could moderate the negative association between depression and cognitive function (17). However, a previous study reported that high education did not buffer the deleterious effect of LLD on cognitive decline (18). Furthermore, in another communitybased sample, those with high CR showed more pronounced cognitive decline as depressive symptoms escalated (19). 

Previous studies in the literature suggest that both CR and WMH are indispensable factors and should be considered  together in the evaluation of the depressive symptoms and cognitive function in the elderly. A few studies have been conducted in normal elderly individuals have shown that education may modify the negative association between WMH and processing speed (20) or other cognitive domains (21). Similarly, cognitive leisure activities may buffer the negative association between WMH and processing speed (22). However, parallel studies in LLD are scarce. Therefore, based on the framework of the vascular hypothesis in LLD, we specifically examined whether CR (using the proxy of education) could modify effects of WMH on depressive symptoms and different cognitive domains. Based on the prior findings, we hypothesized that WMH will be associated with more severe depressive symptoms and cognitive decline in elderly individuals with lower CR than in those with higher CR 

Following the approval of the institutional review board from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (IRB number: IRB104-0928C), we *recruited elderly patients* from the psychiatric department of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. All of them had been informed about the purpose of the study with written consent. Patients were at least 60 years of age, with their first major depressive episode (MDE) occurring after 50 years of age (i.e., late onset). Diagnostic interviews were conducted by certified geriatric psychiatrists (C. Lin and S.W. Lee) based on the DSM-5 criteria were conducted to ascertained the MDE diagnosis. Patients with other major mental illnesses, including psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, and major neurocognitive disorders were excluded. However, patients with anxiety disorders were included owing to high comorbidity with depression. **Elderly controls** recruited via *advertisement presented no life-time history of Axis I major mental disorders*. All participants were right-handed and scored at least 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Other exclusion criteria for both groups included a history of significant head trauma (with loss of consciousness), major neurological disorder, stroke, thyroid dysfunction, or other systemic illnesses. Due to ethical considerations, a steady dose of psychotropics was maintained in LLD patients for at least 2 months before MRI. 经长工纪念医院机构评审委员会批准(IRB编号:IRB104-0928C)，我们从长工纪念医院精神科招募老年患者。所有患者都已在书面同意下被告知研究的目的。患者至少60岁，他们的第一次严重抑郁发作(MDE)发生在50岁之后(即，晚发病)。根据DSM-5标准，由认证老年精神病学家(C. Lin和S.W. Lee)进行诊断访谈，以确定MDE诊断。排除其他重大精神疾病患者，包括精神障碍、双相情感障碍、物质使用障碍和重大神经认知障碍。然而，由于抑郁症的高共病性，焦虑症患者被纳入。通过广告招募的老年人对照组没有表现出I轴主要精神障碍的一生史。所有参与者都是右撇子，在简易精神状态检查(MMSE)中得分至少为24分。两组的其他排除标准包括有严重头部外伤(伴有意识丧失)史、重大神经系统疾病、中风、甲状腺功能障碍或其他系统性疾病。由于伦理考虑，LLD患者在MRI前至少维持稳定剂量的精神药物2个月。
The following assessments were performed on the day of functional MRI (fMRI): *15-item Geriatric Depressive Scale* (**GDS**) (23) and an array of neuropsychological tests including  *digit symbol substitution test* (DSST, where participants need to write down the symbols below an array ofnumbers as fast as they can based on the pairing rules in the instruction), *digit span forward/backward* (i.e. to test the longest sequence one can remember in a normal or reverse order after presented with the sequence), *letter-number sequencing* (LNS, where participants must respectively recite the letters and numbers in an alphabetic and ascending order after given a group ofrandom letters and numbers) (24), *facial memory* (memory domain; where participants are presented with 24 faces, 1 at a time for 2 seconds, and then are asked to identify these faces among 48 faces, 24 seen and 24 unseen), and *category verbal fluency* (language domain; where participants need to name as many words as possible in 60 s in the category of colors, animals, fruits, and towns without repeating). We derived the other two cognitive domains—*processing speed* and *working memory*— by averaging the scores of the DSST plus digit span forward and digit span backward plus LNS. All scores of the neuropsychological tests were standardized by using the mean and standard deviation of scores of the normal controls. The zscore of the DSST was reversed such that higher values in each domain represented higher functioning. ==Education (in years)== was selected a proxy for CR in this study. 在功能磁共振成像(fMRI)当天进行了以下评估:15个项目的老年抑郁量表(GDS)(23)和一系列神经心理测试，包括数字符号替换测试(DSST，参与者需要根据说明中的配对规则尽快写下数字数组下面的符号)，数字跨度(即，在给出序列后，以正常或倒序的方式记忆的最长序列)、字母-数字排序(LNS，参与者在随机给定一组字母和数字后，必须分别按照字母和数字的升序记忆)(24)、面部记忆(记忆域;当参与者看到24张脸，每次1张，持续2秒，然后被要求在48张脸中识别这些脸，24张看到的和24张不看到的)，类别语言流利性(语言域;参与者需要在60秒内说出尽可能多的颜色、动物、水果和城镇类别的单词，不要重复)。我们通过将DSST +前向数字广度和后向数字广度+ LNS的分数平均，得出了另外两个认知领域——处理速度和工作记忆。所有神经心理测试得分均采用正常对照组得分的均值和标准差进行标准化。DSST的zscore颠倒了，每个域的值越高，表示功能越好。在本研究中，教育(以年为单位)被选为CR的代表。
MRI data were collected using an 8-channel head coil on a 3TMRI scanner (Discovery MR750, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). T1weighted structural images were acquired as follows: TR = 8 ms, TE = 3 ms, flip angle = 12°, FOV = 250 × 250 mm2, voxel size = 0.98 × 0.98 × 1 mm3, slice number = 160. Moreover, T2-weighted FLAIR scans were acquired (TR/TE= 9,000 ms/140ms, inversion time = 2,250 ms, matrix = 320 × 224, slice thickness = 3.5 mm, slice number = 32) with a 0.5-mm gap. A semi-automated segmentation procedure was followed to derive total brain volume and WMH volume, as previously described (25). Briefly, WMHwas quantified using the fuzzy connectedness segmentation algorithm on WM lesions fromT2-FLAIR images. WMHwas registered and localized onto the John Hopkins University White Matter Atlas. WMH was subsequently divided by total brain volume and ==*log-transformed to generate the normalized WMH*==, serving as a marker for cerebral vascular burden for linear regression analysis. MRI数据是在3TMRI扫描仪(Discovery MR750, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI)上使用8通道头线圈收集的。T1weighted structural images: TR = 8 ms, TE = 3 ms，翻转角度= 12°，FOV = 250 × 250 mm2，体素尺寸= 0.98 × 0.98 × 1 mm3，切片数= 160。获得t2加权FLAIR扫描(TR/TE= 9000 ms/140ms，反演时间= 2250 ms，基质= 320 × 224，层厚= 3.5 mm，层数= 32)，间隙为0.5 mm。如前所述，采用半自动化的分割过程推导出总脑容量和WMH容量(25)。简单地说，利用模糊连通性分割算法对mt2 - flair图像中的WM病变进行量化。wmh在约翰霍普金斯大学白质地图集上注册并定位。WMH除以总脑容量，对数变换生成归一化的WMH，作为脑血管负荷的标志进行线性回归分析。

We first compared the group differences in demographic and behavioral data as well as WMH loading between patients ofLLD and normal controls. We then performed serial linear regressions using GDS and the four cognitive domains as dependent variables; education, WMH, and the interaction between education and WMH were independent variables, with *age and sex as covariates* of no interest. *Education and WMH were centered with their means* before creating the interaction variable to avoid multi-collinearity. These five independent regressions were repeated in the LLD and control groups separately. All analyses above were performed using SPSS v21  (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), with significance level set at p < 0.05.

### intro
- **Education Level**
	The Verhage system provides a standardized way to measure educational attainment in the Netherlands, but it doesn't directly correspond to the number of years spent in education. However, you can approximate the years of education for each level in the Verhage system based on the typical duration of education in the Netherlands. Here's a rough estimation of the years of education corresponding to each level:	
	1.  Primary education not completed: 0-5 years
	2.  Primary education completed: 6 years
	3.  Lower secondary education or lower vocational education: 9-10 years
	4.  Higher secondary education or intermediate vocational education: 12-13 years
	5.  Higher vocational education (short program): 14-15 years
	6.  Higher vocational education (long program) or university (Bachelor's degree): 16-18 years
	7.  University (Master's or higher degree): 19+ years

*Cognitive* screening was performed using the *CAMCOG* part of the CAMDEX [17]. The CAMCOG total score includes a memory subscore containing orientation and memory, and a CAMCOG non-memory score containing language, attention, praxis, maths, abstraction, and perception. The Mini-Mental State Examination (*MMSE*) is obtained as *part of the CAMCOG* [18]. Cognition was divided into four cognitive domains (language, memory, attention, and visuospatial ability) and two subtests (MMSE, Clock). The variable visuospatial ability was computed with the two CAMCOG sub-scores: perception and praxis constructive. In this study, we explored the CAMCOG total score, MMSE total score, and looked into the cognitive domains language, memory, attention, and visuospatial ability. 

All subjects underwent a 64-detector row *CT* scan of the brain using a Siemens Somatom definition AS 64 slice scanner according to a CT brain protocol for the memory clinic (260 mAs, 120 kV, 64 * 0.6 mm collimation, pitch of 0.55, WC/WW = 40/80, CARE kV = on, dose optimization slider on non-contrast). Oblique coronal, sagittal, and transversal reconstruc- tions were made with bone window 1.5 mm slices, axial slices of 5.0 mm, and oblique coronal slices of 3.0 mm. All CT-scans were reviewed by a radiologist and all scans were visually assessed for atrophy and vascular scores in a consensus meeting by a neurologist and geriatrician. The level of atrophy of the medial temporal lobe was assessed using the *visual MTA-score* by Scheltens (*range 0–4*; 0=no medial temporal atrophy, 4 = maximal medial temporal atrophy) [19]. Presence of *global cortical atrophy (GCA)* was determined using the Pasquier scale (range 0–3, 0 = normal volume, 3 = knife blade atrophy and severe ventricular enlargement [20].

We used SPSS version 24.0. Baseline characteristics comparing SCI, MCI, and AD were analyzed with one-way ANOVA or with Chi-square tests when appropriate. A one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey’s test was used to compare the variable means between SCI, MCI, and AD. *First*, we examined the relationship between education as independent variable and measures of global *cognition* and subtests as *dependent* variables using multiple linear regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, MTA, and GCA for combined groups SCI, MCI, and AD and for groups dementia (AD) versus non-dementia (SCI and MCI) separately. Explained variances (R2) were calculated to examine the magnitude of education as a determinant of cognition. Model 1 describes the relation between age, sex, GCA, MTA and cognition, whereas the R2 change attributable to education is calculated in model 2 by adding education as a predictor of cognition. *Second*, we test the hypothesis that for the same level of cognition, more highly educated patients have more advanced levels of MTA. This was performed by *multiple linear regression*, examining the relation between the *independent variable education*, and *MTA as a dependent variable* adjusted for age, sex, and global atrophy. To *hold the level of cognition* as a constant factor, we additionally adjusted for the total CAMCOG score. In a separate stratification analysis, we calculated these regression coefficients (thus not adjusted for the CAMCOG total score in this analysis) for different strata of CAMCOG scores (CAMCOG total score into five groups: 0–50, 51–60, 61–70, 71–80, 81–90, 91–110). *Finally*, to examine if education affects the relationship between MTA and cognition, we added an *interaction* variable between *education and MTA* in a General Linear model analysis.

Demographic and clinical characteristics of the total population are described in Table 1. The total population had a mean age of 79 years, MCI patients were older than SCI patients (p < 0.01), while patients with AD were older than SCI and MCI patients (p<0.01). Looking at levels of neurodegeneration, MTA and GCA scores were higher in MCI compared to SCI patients (p<0.01), and higher in AD com- pared to SCI and MCI patients (p < 0.01). Comparing levels of education, SCI patients had a higher educa- tion compared to MCI and AD patients (p < 0.05) and MCI patients had higher education compared to AD patients (p < 0.05). In the total population, there were n = 562 patients with low education (Verhage score 1–3), n = 1,094 with middle level education (Verhage score 4 and 5), and n = 526 with high education (Ver- hage score 6 and 7).

*First*, we analyzed the effect of education on different cognitive domains and tests in the total cohort. There was a positive statistically significant effect of education on cognition for combined groups of SCI, MCI, and AD for all tests including the different domains (education in relation to MMSE: regression coefficient (B) = 1.05, p < 0.001; clock drawing B = 0.14, p < 0.001; CAMCOG total score B = 3.83, p < 0.001; memory B = 0.97, p < 0.001; attention B = 0.36, p < 0.001; language B = 0.85, p < 0.001; visuospatial ability B = 0.58, p < 0.001). Regression coefficients for diagnosis subtypes are shown in Table 2. To examine the difference between patients according to their disease stage, we used the General Linear Modal to determine the differences between non-dementia and dementia. The patients with dementia had a significant higher regression coefficient than the non-dementia patients on most of the cognitive measurements, indicating that the

effect of education is stronger in the dementia stage. This is further illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. In addition, we examined the contribution of education as a predictor of cognition including global cognition (CAMCOG and MMSE) as well as respective cogni- tive subtests, using the R2 change from model 1 to model 2. These results show that education is a strong determinant for all the cognitive tests (p < 0.001), with a high level of 11% explained variance for the total CAMCOG score (MMSE 8%, clock 5%, mem- ory 6%, attention 6%, language 11%, visual ability 8%).

To summarize, education is related to cognition, while regression coefficients tested statistically significantly higher in AD than SCI/MCI.

*Second*, multiple linear regression was used to test the hypothesis that for the same level of cognition, more highly educated patients have more advanced levels of MTA. The analysis revealed a significant positive effect of education on MTA at the same level of cognition for combined groups of SCI, MCI and AD (B = 0.07, p < 0.001), adjusted for age, sex, and global cortical atrophy. This indicates that highly educated patients have more advanced levels of MTA at similar cognition. Looking at the dif- ferent subdiagnoses, this effect was only significant in AD patients (B = 0.06, p < 0.001) but not in SCI (B=0.04,p=0.14)andMCI(B=0.01,p=0.60).This further adds to differences according to disease stage (demented versus non-demented patients) examined in the previous paragraph with a different statistical analysis.

Next, we examined the effect of education on MTA calculating these regression coefficients for different strata of CAMCOG scores (0–50, 51–60, 61–70, 71–80, 81–90, 91–110) testing the hypothesis that after a certain decrease of cognitive function the protective value fades out. In the CAMCOG strata under 90 and above 50, education was significantly related to MTA, but this relation was not significant above 90 and below 50 (Table 3). These results suggest that education does not operate as a reserve at the both ends of the spectrum of the CAMCOG scores. For the low side of this spectrum, these data indeed indicate that at a certain level of cognitive performance, i.e., a CAMCOG total score of 50, education loses its compensatory mechanism (comparable MMSE score of 12). Analysis of the regression coefficients of the covariates of education in relation to MTA (age, sex, and GCA) in the different strata shows a consistent pattern of non- significance of sex and high significance of GCA (all p < 0.001). In addition, the regression coefficients of age in the 6 respective strata from the highest (CAMCOG 91–110) to the lowest (CAMCOG < 50) were: 0.03 ± 0.01, p < 0.001; 0.04 ± 0.01, p < 0.001; 0.03 ± 0.01, p < 0.001; 0.03 ± 0.01, p < 0.001; 0.02 ± 0.01, p < 0.01; 0.01 ± 0.01, p = 0.54. The stratum of those with CAMCOG 91–110 included 248 SCI, 47 MCI, and 16 AD patients, with a mean MMSE score of 28.2 and mean MTA of 0.8. Those with CAMCOG 50 or lower included 0 SCI, 9 MCI, and 193 AD patients with a mean MMSE of 11.6 and mean MTA of 2.5. The dynamic range of MTA scores (lowest mean of right and left score 0, highest 4) in the different CAMCOG strata was 0 to 4 in the strata 0–50, 51–60, 61–70, 71–80, 81–90, and 0 to 3.5 in the stratum 91–110. Thus, there were no patients with an MTA score of 4 in those with a CAMCOG score from 91 to 110. An MTA score of 4 is a very infrequent finding in our study with patient numbers of 9, 7, 8, 7, and 4 in the respective strata of 0–50, 51–60, 61–70, 71–80, and 81–90.

In the *final* analysis, a statistically significant interaction effect was demonstrated between MTA and education (p < 0.01) in relation to cognition. This shows that the relationship between MTA and cognition is modified by education (Table 4). At a higher level of education, the regression line was less steep, indicating that the relationship between MTA and cognition is stronger in lower educated patients and less strong in higher educated patients (Fig. 3).

### Intro
Educational attainment is widely accepted as a cognitive reserve variable. However, few studies have demonstrated that education statistically moderates the effects of pathology on cognition. Here, we explored this issue in a sample of 441 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment participants from the **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort** who *had AD markers (Ab42, tau, structural brain volumes) at baseline* and underwent *cognitive* testing at baseline and at *6-month, 12- month, and 24-month time points*. An AD-related biomarker (atrophy/pathology) composite at baseline was developed using stepwise backward linear regression. Potential moderation effects of education on the relationship between AD biomarkers and cognition were explored using linear mixed models. Education was positively correlated with cognition, and biomarkers were negatively correlated with cognition, across domains and diagnostic groups. However, education generally did not moderate the effects of biomarkers on baseline or longitudinal cognition. Our results do not support the hypothesis that education protects cognitive function from brain pathology in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuro- imaging Initiative cohort, questioning its accepted status as a reserve variable.

Educational attainment and its correlates have positive effects on cognitive performance across the life span (Brewster et al., 2014; Salthouse, 1991a,b). Such findings have raised the possibility that education may promote cognitive reserve (CR) (Stern, 2002). A number of studies have provided apparent support for education as a CR variable, reporting more severe Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology in those with higher versus lower education (Garibotto et al., 2008; Kemppainen et al., 2008). However, new consensus guidelines concerning CR research (Stern et al., 2018) suggest that conclusions concerning CR variables should be based on statistical moderation between pathology and clinical/cognitive status variables. That is, cognitive performance should be predicted by the interaction between a purported CR variable and brain status.

Only a few studies with large sample sizes have reported such statistical moderation (Bennett et al., 2005, 2003, Stern et al., 1995, 1992). Furthermore, these findings are counterbalanced by several null results (Koepsell et al., 2008; Roe et al., 2007; Stern et al., 1999). Potential discrepancies between previous results could include the clinical status of participants, the cognitive domain tested, and the use of cross-sectional versus longitudinal designs. Here, we comprehensively explored these possibilities by examining if education moderates the effects of pathology on either baseline or longitudinal *memory (MEM)* and/or *executive function (EF)* in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and/or AD clinical groups.

We accessed data from **441 participants with MCI or AD** from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 that had summary measures of MRI regional volumes, cerebrospinal fluid AD pathology (n=426), composite scores of MEM (Crane et al., 2012) and EF (Gibbons et al., 2012), and basic demographic information (Table 1) at baseline (Figure S1). *Composite measures* of baseline atrophy/ *pathology* were derived empirically *based* on their *association* with scores per *cognitive* domain. Baseline composite measures of atrophy/pathology here included both *structural volumes* and concentration ratio of *tau/Ab42* in the cerebrospinal fluid (Bakkour et al., 2009; Fagan et al., 2007; Shaw et al., 2009). Individual structures were ICV-normalized, and both structural volumes and tau/Ab42 ratio were z-scored relative to the group mean before they were entered into the composites. *Backward elimination* was used to remove the least significant predictor one at a time until only z- scored predictors with p < 0.05 were remaining, which were averaged to form the cognitive domain-specific composites.

Using SPSS, linear mixed models were then used to determine if baseline pathology and education *predict* *cognitive* scores at *baseline* and *longitudinally* for both MCI and AD groups at p < 0.05, with MEM or EF scores as the dependent variables. Models included all possible interactions excluding age and gender (pathology X time, education X time, pathology X education, and pathology X education X time).

There was a main effect of education on both cognitive domains in the AD and MCI groups (Tables 2 and 3). There were no significant education X time interactions in either cognitive domain, for either group (Tables 2 and 3).

The specific pathology variables predictive of each cognitive composite variable are listed in Table S1. The MEM and EF pathology composite measures were highly significant predictors of their respective baseline cognitive domain scores as listed in Tables 2 and 3 (all p values 0.001).

There were no significant education X pathology or education X pathology X time interactions in either cognitive domain for either diagnostic group (Tables 2 and 3). Further investigation using an age median split yielded the same conclusion for MEM (Tables S2, S3) with a mixed conclusion for EF (Tables S2, S3; Figure S2).

Our results indicate that higher educational attainment was associated with better cognitive functioning in MCI and AD, in both MEM and EF domains. However, education generally did not moderate the effects of atrophy/pathology, time or their interaction on cognitive function. Only in a subgroup of *younger AD participants* was a moderating effect of education observed and this effect was *selective to EF*. These results are consistent with other studies with large samples (Koepsell et al., 2008; Roe et al., 2007; Vemuri et al., 2011). Overall, our results suggest that education is an insufficient proxy for CR. However, the selective CR effect we observed in a younger AD subgroup leaves open the possibility that education may protect EF against significant pathology before additional brain declines associated with advanced aging (see Supplementary Material for the complete version of this article).

## F. Yasuno 2020. Interaction effect of Alzheimer’s disease pathology and education, occupation, and socioeconomic status as a proxy for cognitive reserve on cognitive performance: in vivo positron emission tomography study (2020)
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/14.%20Interaction%20effect%20of%20alzheimer's%20disease%20pathology%20and%20education,%20occupation,%20and%20socioeconomic%20status%20as%20a%20proxy%20for%20cognitive%20reserve%20on%20cognitive%20performance-%20In%20vivo%20positron%20emission%20tomography%20study.pdf)
### Intro
Educational attainment, occupation, and socioeconomic status have been regarded as major factors influencing cognitive reserve (CR). This study aimed to investigate the interaction effect of amyloid-β/tau burden and education/occupation/socioeconomic status as a proxy for CR on cognitive performance. We analyzed the datasets of the *Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative*. We included clinically *normal* subjects and patients with *mild cognitive impairment* or *Alzheimer’s disease* who had undergone a florbetapir scan within 1 year of a flortaucipir (AV-1451) scan (n = 127). Partial correlation analysis between the standardized uptake value ratio of florbetapir/AV-1451 and the proxy for CR was performed with the 13-item Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) score as a covariate. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of ADAS-cog performance based on the interaction between the imaging biomarkers and the proxy for CR. We found a significant positive partial correlation between educational level and tau pathology in Braak stage 1/2 areas, and we observed significantly higher tau accumulation among participants with higher education when ADAS-cog score was used as a covariate. The interaction between tau and education was a good predictor of cognitive function, with higher tau accumulation showing a greater association with higher ADAS- cog score among participants with less education than among those with more education. Our findings indicate the protective effect of education against cognitive dysfunction in early-stage Alzheimer’s disease pathology and sug- gest that education may exert a beneficial effect by reducing the adverse cognitive consequences of tau aggregation.

The *13-item Alzheimer's disease assessment*, also known as the Short Test of Mental Status, is a brief screening tool used to assess cognitive function in individuals suspected of having Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia. It consists of 13 questions that assess various cognitive domains, including orientation, attention, memory, language, and visuospatial ability. The total score on the 13-item Alzheimer's disease assessment ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.

The **ADAS-cog** consists of a battery of 11 tests that assess various cognitive domains, including memory, language, praxis, and orientation. The test takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and is administered by a trained healthcare professional. The ADAS-cog is scored on a scale from 0 to 70, with *higher scores* indicating *greater cognitive impairment*. A score of 0 indicates normal cognitive function, while a score of 70 indicates severe cognitive impairment. The ADAS-cog has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of cognitive function in individuals with Alzheimer's disease and is widely used in clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of potential treatments.

Thanks to advances in positron emission tomography (PET) using radiotracers that bind to amyloid-β (Aβ), it has become clear that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has a long preclinical course whereby clinically normal (CN) subjects show biomarker abnormalities up to 15 years before the onset of dementia.1-3 Consequently, medical researchers have turned their focus to the iden- tification and treatment of preclinical AD,4 particularly the factors that influence the relationship between cog- nition and pathological burden. Cognitive reserve (CR) is one such factor. Previous studies have attempted to clarify how some individuals, despite the burden of AD pathol- ogy, maintain normal cognitive performance,5,6 which decreases the risk or delays the appearance of symptomatic AD.7,8 With regard to CR, it has been postulated that individual differences in the cognitive processes or neural networks underlying task perfor- mance allow some people to cope better than others with brain damage.8 It is believed that greater CR compensates for the damage due to neu- rodegeneration: individuals with high CR cope better with the onset of dementia and can maintain a nor- mal cognitive level for a longer time than individuals with low CR.9-11 Patients with AD who have high CR should have more advanced AD pathology than those with low CR but the same level of cognitive dysfunction.6

Previous PET studies using radiotracers that bind to Aβ demonstrated that amyloid accumulation has a weak but continual effect on brain function.12-14 Recently, the availability of radiotracers that bind to tau (e.g.18F-flortaucipir (AV-1451)15) has allowed in vivo imaging of tau pathology. Rentz et al. examined whether intelligence quotient as a proxy for CR modified the effect of tau and/or amyloid on cognitive function in clinical and preclinical AD.13 They showed that intelligence quotient may protect against AD processes and can enable some patients to maintain stable cognitive function despite increased tau and Aβ burden.13

Educational attainment, occupation, and socioeconomic status (SES) have been regarded as major fac- tors reflecting or influencing CR.7,12,14,16-18 Education mainly reflects the intellectual and environmental factors during the early-life stage, while occupation and SES are related to those at the mid- to late-life stage. However, no study has assessed the interaction effect of AD pathology and education, occupation, and SES as a proxy for CR on cognitive performance. In this study, we investigated the interaction between Aβ/tau burden and education/occupation/SES in a sample of CN subjects and patients with mild cognitive impair- ment (MCI) or AD. Our aim was to examine whether intellectual and environmental factors affecting CR dur- ing the early-life stage and/or the middle- to late-life stage can protect against AD pathology.

Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public–private partnership; it is led by Michael W. Weiner, MD, the principal investigator. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imag- ing, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. For up-to-date information, see http://www.adni-info.org. Approval has been obtained from the appropriate insti- tutional review boards. Written informed consent was obtained from all ADNI participants before the study. This study consisted of patients diagnosed with *MCI or AD and CN subjects*. The inclusion criteria for CN were a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 24–30 and the absence of depression, MCI, and dementia. For patients with MCI, the criteria were an MMSE score of 24–30, objective memory loss measured by education-adjusted scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II, a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5, the absence of significant levels of impairment in other cognitive domains, essentially preserved activities of daily living, and an absence of dementia. For participants with AD, the criteria were an MMSE score of 20–26 and probable AD according the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria.

We included *ADNI-2 and ADNI-3* data, with no duplicate entries, from subjects aged 60–80years (inclusive) who had undergone a florbetapir (AV-45) scan within 1year of an AV-1451 scan (total, n = 189; CN, n = 134; MCI, n = 44; AD, n = 11). Information on education, occupation, and SES index classification was complete for all subjects. The subjects had also undergone neuropsychological assess- ment within 1 year of both AV-45 and AV-1451 PET imaging. We excluded subjects who were taking anti-dementia, antidepressant, and/or other behavioural medication (CN, n = 33; MCI, n = 20; AD, n = 9). Finally, we used the data from 127 subjects for the analysis.

The sample for analysis consisted of 101 CN individuals and 26 individuals diagnosed with either MCI (n = 24) or mild AD dementia (n = 2). Those with MCI and AD were placed in a single group (MCI/AD group). For all participants, general data (i.e. age, sex, years of education, primary occupation during most of adult life, *MMSE score*, and 13-item Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) score) were extracted from the ADNI databases.

Education and occupation were examined as proxy candidates for CR. Occupation was coded as 1–9 based on the Hollingshead Index of Social Status (HI); *educational level was graded on a 1–7 scale*. Occupation was coded based on a full-time job or, if it was the only source of income for the subject, a part- time job. Education was coded based on the highest year of schooling completed by the subject. Further, *SES was calculated* as another proxy for CR *based on the education and occupation* scores by using the following equation: HI = education level × 3 + occupation × 5.20 *HI was categorized into four groups:* group 1, score <29; group 2, score 29–41; group 3, score 42–53; and group 4, score >53.

The neuroimaging data were also obtained from the ADNI databases (https://ida.loni.usc.edu) for our study. Data for 18F-AV-1451 imaging from ADNI-2 and ADNI-3 were analyzed in this study, and AV-45 scans were collected within 1 year of the AV-1451 scans. The acquisition protocol and image preprocessing of these data are publicly available on the ADNI website (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). Details of ADNI methods for image acquisition and processing can be found at www.adni-info.org/methods.

The dataset indicates the *mean AV-45 uptake* in cortical grey matter-weighted florbetapir in the regions of interest (ROIs) for all participants. The ROIs included the bilateral frontal, anterior/posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, and lateral temporal cortices, as defined by the ADNI group. ROI-based AV-45 *standardized* uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated with reference to the AV-45 uptake mean of the whole cerebellum. The details of the data processing method are described in ‘UC Berkeley- AV45 Analysis Methods’ which is available online (https://ida. loni.usc.edu/). AV-1451 is a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent that is used to visualize **tau protein** aggregates in the brain. The *Braak staging system* divides Alzheimer's disease pathology into *six stages*. Stage 1 and 2 are considered early stages, where tau protein first appears in specific regions of the brain, such as the transentorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Stage 3 and 4 are considered middle stages, where tau protein spreads to other areas of the brain, including the neocortex. Stage 5 and 6 are considered advanced stages, where tau protein is present in almost all areas of the brain.

For the dataset of AV-1451, tracer retention was quantified in ROIs that anatomically approximate the pathological stages of tangle deposition delineated by Braak and Braak. *Weighted mean SUVR* was calcu- lated from three composite *ROIs* that correspond to the anatomical *definitions of Braak stages 1/2* (entorhinal cortex and hippocampus), 3/4 (limbic), and 5/6 (neocortical) with reference to the AV-1451 uptake mean of the inferior cerebellum. The details of the data processing method are described in ‘UC Berkeley- Flortaucipir (AV-1451) Processing Methods’ which is available online (https://ida.loni.usc.edu/).

Differences in demographic characteristics between the CN and MCI /AD groups were examined with *t- tests* for continuous variables and χ2 tests for dichotomous variables. *Partial correlation* analysis between the mean SUVR of AV-45/AV-1451 from composite ROIs and the CR proxy (level of education, occupation, and SES (HI)) for all subjects was evaluated with age, sex, clinical status (CN and MCI /AD), and ADAS-cog score as covariates. Mean SUVR values of AV-45/ AV-1451 from composite ROIs were compared between groups of lower and higher CR proxy (level of education, occupation, and SES (HI)) with ANCOVA using age, sex, clinical status, and ADAS-cog score as covariates. In addition, a *stepwise backward* deletion *multiple linear regression* analysis was performed to determine the predictors of ADAS-cog performance; the analysis was based on the interaction between the PET biomarker (AV-45 and/or AV-1451 SUVR) and the CR proxy for which the analysis showed a relationship. The dependent variable was the ADAS-cog score, and the independent variables were age, sex, clinical sta- tus, PET biomarker, the proxy for CR, and the interaction between the PET biomarker and the proxy for CR. Statistical analysis was performed with *SPSS* for Windows 23.0 (IBM Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical tests were two-tailed, and significance was defined as P < 0.05/n using Bonferroni’s correction (where n refers to the number of multiple comparisons).

The demographic characteristics of the CN and MCI/AD groups are displayed in *Table 1*. There were no differences between groups in terms of sex, age, level of education, occupation, and SES (HI). We found no significant difference in MMSE scores between the groups, but the MCI/AD group had significantly higher ADAS-cog scores. Cortical Aβ accumulation was similar between the groups, but the MCI/AD group had higher levels of tau in the measured brain areas. We found a significant partial *correlation* between level of *education and tau* accumulation in *Braak stage 1/2 areas*, including the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, with age, sex, clinical status, and ADAS-cog score as covariates (Table 2; Fig. 1). We did *not* observe a relationship between level of education and cortical amyloid or tau accumulation in Braak *stage 3/4 and 5/6 areas*. We did not find a significant partial correlation between occupation/SES and accumulation of amyloid/tau (Table 2). 

We found a significantly larger tau accumulation in Braak stage 1/2 areas in the group with a higher level of education, with age, sex, clinical status, and ADAS- cog score as covariates. We did not observe a difference in cortical amyloid or tau accumulation in Braak stage 3/4 and 5/6 areas (Table 3). We found no signifi- cant difference in covariates between the groups according to level of education (lower vs higher): age: 71.8  4.6 and 72.7  4.6 years (t = 1.09, P = 0.28); sex (men/women): 26/32 and 37/32 (χ2 = 0.98, P = 0.32); clinical status (MCI + AD/CN): 13/45 and 13/56 (χ2 = 0.25, P = 0.62); ADAS-cog score: 13.0  5.5 and 11.4  4.3 (t = 1.81, P = 0.07). We did not find a significant difference in amyloid or tau accumulation between groups according to occupation or SES (lower vs higher) (Table 3). 

Stepwise backward deletion multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine which factors were the best predictors of cognitive ability (Table 4). The dependent variable was the ADAS-cog score. The independent variables were age, sex, clinical status, education (HI score), tau (AV-1451 SUVR in Braak stage 1/2 areas), and the interaction of tau and education (tau × education). Sex and education were removed, and age, clinical status, tau, and interaction between tau and education remained in the final model as predictors of ADAS-cog score (Table 4). The interaction between tau and education indicated that higher tau accumulation led to a stronger relationship with higher ADAS-cog score among participants with a lower level of education than among those with a higher level. Figure 2 shows a visual representation of the association between slope in ADAS-cog score and tau accumulation in the groups with lower and higher levels of education after adjust- ment for age and clinical status.

### Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo PET imaging study to assess the interaction effect of AD pathology and education, occupation, and SES as a proxy for CR on cognitive performance. We found a significant positive correlation between educational level and tau pathology in Braak stage 1/2 areas and, when age, sex, clinical status, and ADAS-cog score were considered as covariates, a significantly larger tau accumulation in the same areas in the higher level of education group. The interaction between tau and education was a good predictor of cognitive function: higher tau accumulation led to a stronger relationship with higher ADAS-cog score among participants with a lower level of education than among those with a higher level. These findings are in line with the CR theory and with a number of previous neuroimaging studies, indicating a compensatory effect of educa- tion against the accumulation of pathological dam- age.22 In other words, our findings suggest that, at least in the early stage of AD pathology, education compensates for neurodegeneration and allows the maintenance of patients’ cognitive performance as previously argued by others.22-25

In this sample, the relationship between education and amyloid aggregation showed no statistical significance (P = 0.37), whereas the relationship between education and tau aggregation in Braak stage 1/2 areas was significant (P =0.003). The increased strength of the relationship between tau and education compared to Aβ may be associated with the more proximal association of tau to cognitive dysfunction. Overall, our findings support the idea that education as a proxy for CR may protect against AD pathology. The relationship between education and tau only in the Braak stage 1/2 areas further indicates the possibility that education provides a protective effect, especially in early-stage AD, when pathology has started to spread within Braak stage 1/2 areas.

The mechanism by which education provides these effects is unknown. Higher educational attain- ment may be suggestive of early cognitive enrich- ment, which may increase neuronal signalling, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity.28,29 Alterna- tively, educational achievement may be a marker for those with high pre-existing neural or cognitive capacity. These factors may be related to CR. In con- trast, we found no significant relationship between tau pathology and occupation/SES, which is directly associated with lifelong mental and cognitive stimula- tion. Higher occupation/SES is often associated with higher intelligence and a healthier lifestyle, less dis- ease, and lower exposure to toxic factors because of a better environment. Although we expected that individuals with higher occupation/SES had better intellectual and environmental factors at the mid- to late-life stage, protection against AD pathology was not observed in them. One explanation for the rela- tionship between protection against AD pathology and education, but not occupation/SES, might be that these are mainly determined by intellectual and environmental factors during the early-life stage, and their effect in the midlife stage may be smaller. Fur- ther study is necessary to verify this speculation.

In our previous study, we found significantly larger cortical Aβ accumulation in CN subjects with a low level of education than in subjects with a high level of education.30 Our previous findings suggested that education in the early-life stage has a negative rela- tionship with Aβ deposition. This suggestion is not inconsistent with the CR hypothesis. More educated people might be prone to a greater inhibitory effect against Aβ deposition in the early stage of AD pathol- ogy. At the same time, they have a greater CR capacity, and for dementia to manifest, greater path- ological changes are required. However, in this study, no relationship was found between level of education and Aβ deposition. The discrepancies in the findings between these two studies may be due to the differ- ences in the number of participants and population background. The ADNI may include individuals with relatively high social status, which would cause potential population bias. Indeed, the percentage of individuals who completed tertiary education was 73.2% in this study versus 46.7% in our previous study.

There are several limitations to our study. First, because we excluded subjects who were taking anti- dementia, antidepressant, and/or other behavioural medication, a relatively small number of patients with MCI or AD dementia was included in our study, which limits the applicability of our results to late- stage AD pathology. As to the possibility that the inclusion of small number of AD patients (n = 2) drove the observed results, it is unlikely: we found no change in the results with a subanalysis excluding the AD patients (data not shown). Second, we ana- lyzed only the cross-sectional datasets of the ADNI, which did not allow us to examine the direct causality between educational attainment and AD-related bio- markers based on brain imaging. Third, unlike a recent report that indicated a modifying effect of CR on Aβ deposition in apolipoprotein E4 carriers,31 we could not examine this association as genotyping of apolipoprotein E4 was not performed in the entire sample. Lastly, our findings might be, at least in part, attributable to the sampling bias of the ADNI study per se, because ADNI participants were those who had access to research institutes or major psychiatric hospitals in the USA and had some interest in partici- pating in this study. This kind of bias would espe- cially affect SES. However, we emphasize that we were still able to identify the significant effect of inter- action between tau and education on cognitive func- tion despite the possibly skewed distribution of the data used in this study.

In summary, we found that the interaction between tau and education was a good predictor of cognitive function and that larger tau accumulation had a stronger relationship with higher ADAS-cog score among participants with a lower level of education than among those with a higher level. Our findings provide further evidence of the protective effect of education on cognitive dysfunction in the early stage of AD pathology and indicate that education may decrease the adverse cognitive consequences of tau aggregation. However, we found no significant rela- tionship between the tau pathology and occupation/ SES, which is directly associated with lifelong mental and cognitive stimulation. Although we expected that the people with higher occupation/SES had a better environment at the mid- to late-life stage, they have no protective effect on cognitive dysfunction due to AD pathology. One explanation of CR’s relationship with education, rather than with occupation/SES, was that CR was mainly determined by intellectual and environmental factors during early-life stage; the effect of factors on CR after the midlife stage is smaller than those of early stage. Further study is necessary to verify this speculation.

### Intro
Variability in cognitive functions in healthy and pathological aging is often explained by educational attainment. However, it remains unclear to which extent different disease states alter protective effects of education. We aimed to investigate *whether* protective effects of education on cognition *depend* on (1) clinical *diagnosis* severity, and (2) the *neuropathological* burden within a diagnosis in a memory clinic setting. In this *cross-sectional* study, we included 108 patients with subjective cognitive decline (*SCD*, median age 71, IQR (66–78), 43% men], 190 with mild cognitive impairment (*MCI*, median age 78, IQR (73–82), 44% men], and 245 with Alzheimer’s disease dementia (*AD*) (median age 80, IQR (76–84), 35% men]. We combined *visual ratings of hippocampal atrophy*, *global atrophy*, and *white matter hyperintensities* on MRI into a single neuropathology score. To investigate whether the contribution of education to cognitive performance differed across SCD, MCI, and AD, we employed several multiple linear regression models, stratified by diagnosis and *adjusted for age, sex, and neurodegeneration*. We re-ran each model with an additional interaction term to investigate whether these effects were influenced by neuropathological burden for each diagnostic group separately. False discovery rate (FDR) corrections for multiple comparisons were applied. We observed significant positive associations between education and performance for global cognition and executive functions (all adjusted p-values < 0.05). As *diagnosis* became more *severe*, however, the strength of these *associations decreased* (all adjusted p-values < 0.05). Education related to episodic memory only at relatively lower levels of neuropathology in SCD (β = −0.23, uncorrected p = 0.02), whereas education related to episodic memory in those with higher levels of neuropathology in MCI (β = 0.15, uncorrected p = 0.04). However, these interaction effects did not survive FDR-corrections. Altogether, our results demonstrated that positive effects of education on cognitive functioning reduce with diagnosis severity, but the role of neuropathological burden within a particular diagnosis was small and warrants further investigation. Future studies may further unravel the extent to which different dimensions of an individual’s disease severity contribute to the waxing and waning of protective effects in cognitive aging.

The process of aging is accompanied by alterations in cognitive functions, ranging in severity from normal aging-related changes, to subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and, ultimately, dementia (Jack et al., 2018; Salthouse, 2019). Within each diagnostic group, however, there is considerable inter-individual variability in the extent to which cognitive decline manifests itself (Cabeza et al., 2018; Soldan et al., 2020). Educational attainment is a major contributor to this heterogeneity, where individuals with higher levels of education are not only at a lower risk of developing cognitive impairments (Livingston et al., 2020), but also demonstrate better cognitive performance than those with lower educational attainment, sometimes even in advanced stages of pathological aging (Lövdén et al., 2020; Seblova et al., 2020; Stern et al., 2020). The extent to which the positive effects of education are sustained across SCD, MCI, and Alzheimer’s disease dementia (AD) remains poorly understood. It has been suggested that disease state may attenuate such effects (Stern, 2012; Gregory et al., 2017; Mungas et al., 2021), and previous studies have demonstrated that the benefits of higher education become less pronounced or disappear entirely as disease severity increases (Ye et al., 2013; Soldan et al., 2015; Groot et al., 2018). In contrast, recent findings revealed stronger education-cognition associations in AD relatively to SCD and MCI (Staekenborg et al., 2020). Furthermore, neuropathological burden varies greatly within each diagnostic group (Mehta and Schneider, 2021), and the protective effects of education may consequently vary as a function of neuropathological severity (Perneczky et al., 2009; Mungas et al., 2018, 2021).

In this cross-sectional study, we therefore investigated how different syndromal states that vary in neuropathological severity may alter the positive effects of education on cognitive functions in a memory clinic population. More specifically, we investigated whether this relationship differed (1) across diagnostic categories with varying levels of clinical severity (SCD, MCI, and AD), and (2) within each diagnostic category based on the severity of neuropathological features.

For this retrospective study, we included a total of 543 participants; 108 with SCD, 190 with MCI, and 245 with dementia due to AD. Data from this study sample were extracted from a database containing data of patients who were referred for memory complaints to the *memory clinic at Gelre Hospital in Zutphen, Netherlands*, between November 2004 and February 2015. All participants underwent a comprehensive clinical and neurological evaluation, neuropsychological assessment, blood screening, electroencephalogram, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; Overdorp et al., 2014). Patients were *excluded* from the present study if MRI data were missing and/or of too poor quality for assessment. Each clinical diagnosis was established within multidisciplinary consensus meetings and in accordance with the established criteria. Diagnosis of MCI was based on the Petersen et al. (2001) criteria. Diagnosis of probable AD was based on the DSM-IV-TR criteria for dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (APA, 2000). Although assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers is not part of the standard diagnostic work-up in the Netherlands for diagnosing AD, CSF biomarkers were additionally obtained as supportive evidence in case no consensus was reached. Those patients who neither demonstrated any cognitive impairments after neuropsychological assessment using age- and education adjusted normative data, nor suffered from a psychiatric or neurological disorder, were classified as having SCD.

**Educational** attainment was measured using the Dutch education classification system, which distinguishes different educational levels, rather than using the years of education that are typically used in the Anglo-Saxon world. This educational classification is comparable with the International Standard Classification of Education (UNESCO, 2011), and results in a *score between 1 and 7*: (1) unfinished primary school, (2) finished primary school, (3) unfinished low-level secondary education, (4) lower vocational training, (5) advanced vocational training or lower professional education, (6) finished higher professional education or senior general secondary education, and (7) obtained a university degree (Verhage, 1964). Considering the low prevalence of individuals with unfinished primary school (n = 7) and a university degree (n = 31), we made the *categorical* distinction between *low* (Verhage scores 1–3), *average* (4–5), and *high* education level (6–7; Zhou et al., 2019).

All **neuropsychological tests** were administered and subsequently analyzed by two experienced neuropsychologists, that were blinded to all medical records at the time. A detailed overview of the assessment protocol and tests has been described previously (Overdorp et al., 2014). For the present study, we only included tests with available normative data. Briefly, we incorporated the total score of the Mini-Mental State Examination (*MMSE*; Folstein et al., 1975), the total score of the Visual Association Test (*VAT*; Lindeboom et al., 2002), the *immediate and delayed recall* of the 8-Word Test of the Amsterdam Dementia Screening (de Jonghe et al., 1994), the total number correct of the *Semantic/Verbal Fluency Test* (1-min animal/profession naming), the total score of the *Frontal Assessment Battery* (FAB; Dubois et al., 2000), the time to complete part A of the *Trail Making Test* (TMT; Reitan, 1958), and the *TMT ratio score* (time to complete B/A).

We generated *compound scores* for three cognitive domains: global cognition, episodic memory, and executive functioning. First, raw test scores were *z-standardized* using the mean and standard deviation of the whole study sample. We *inverted the z-scores of the TMT*, so that *higher z-scores* are always indicative of *better cognitive* performance. Compound scores were then calculated for each cognitive domain by taking the *average* of the *z-scores* from the available (sub-)tasks of an individual corresponding to that domain. **Global** cognition was based on scores of the MMSE, VAT, 8-Word Test, Verbal Fluency, FAB, TMT A, and TMT ratio; **episodic memory** on the VAT and 8- Word test; **executive functioning** on Verbal Fluency, FAB, and TMT ratio. If participants were unable to complete part B of the TMT (N = 112), which primarily occurred in patients with MCI (N = 40) and AD (N = 65), the lowest possible z-score of the sample was assigned. Participant characteristics for the individual (sub-)test scores, including an overview of missing data, are displayed in Supplementary Table A.

All **MRI** scans were obtained using a 1.5 Tesla GE-Signa Horizon LX scanner. Briefly, the MRI protocol included the following sequences: whole brain axial and coronal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences (TR/TE 10.000/160 ms); a sagittal T1-weighted sequence (TR/TE 300/4 ms); and an axial T2-weighted sequence (TR/TE 6,500/105 ms). Three experienced independent observers (EO, JC, and JO), blinded to the clinical diagnoses and neuropsychological test scores, *visually rated* white matter hyperintensities (*WMH*), *medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA)*, and *global atrophy (GA)*. In this study, we employed qualitative visual rating scales as these are easily applicable in clinical practice and, relatively to volumetric measures, provide comparable or even more reliable assessments of neuropathology (Gouw et al., 2006; Persson et al., 2018; Topiwala et al., 2019). WMH were rated on axial FLAIR and T2-weighted images using the Fazekas scale, providing a score between 0–3 based on the deep and periventricular areas of the brain (Fazekas et al., 1987). MTA was rated on coronal T1-weighted images with a 5-point (0–4) scale, considering the height of the hippocampus as well as the width of the choroid fissure and temporal horn of the left and right MTA (Scheltenset al., 1992). GA was rated on a 4-point (0–3) rating scale using all available MRI sequences, and represented the mean score for cortical atrophy based on the width of gyri and sulci across the whole cerebrum (Scheltens et al., 1997). As we were interested in capturing the accumulation of neuropathological damage rather than the effects of a particular type of neuropathology, we *combined* the effects of *MTA, GA, and WMH* to obtain a *single measure* indicative of neuropathology per patient in relation to each separate cognitive domain. To accomplish this, first, separate multiple linear regression models were performed using the cognitive domain scores as dependent variables and the measures of neuropathology as predictors. As sample sizes differed across the diagnostic groups, with substantially less cases of SCD, we wanted to make sure that our neuropathology metric was not biased by the number of patients per group. To this end, a bootstrap scheme was adopted. Across 100 replications, we randomly selected 75 cases from each diagnosis group. Within each bootstrap, *leave one out cross validation* (LOOCV) was applied to retrieve optimal model parameters. The resulting *intercepts and regression weights* were *averaged* to obtain the *final parameters*, and were subsequently *inverted* to retrieve the final measure of neuropathological burden (the *higher this score*, the *more neurodegeneration* was present that was relevant to a particular cognitive domain). These final burden scores allowed us to identify whether cognitive-domain specific neuropathology scores affect the relationship between education and cognitive functioning.

Demographics, vascular risk factors, cognitive performance and measures of brain degeneration were compared between groups using univariate tests (analysis of variance, ANOVA; Chi-squared test; Mann–Whitney U test; and Kruskall–Wallis test, where appropriate). Post hoc pairwise comparisons (SCD vs. MCI; SCD vs. AD; MCI vs. AD) were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR) adjustments.

*First*, to investigate whether the contribution of *education* to *cognitive* performance differed across the different clinical diagnoses (SCD, MCI, and AD), we applied Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) models. The cognitive domain scores functioned as outcome variables and education level, diagnostic group, and the interaction between education level and diagnostic group as predictors. Subsequently, to further investigate the direction of significant interactions, several multiple linear regression models were performed stratified by diagnostic group, and the resulting slopes of education were compared pairwise using Welch T-tests (SCD vs. MCI, SCD vs. AD). All analyses were corrected for age, sex, and neuropathology scores.

*Second*, we investigated whether the *effects of education* differed as a *function of neuropathology* within each diagnosis group. We performed another set of multiple linear regression models, but now separately for each diagnosis group, and education level, neuropathology, and the *interaction* between education and neuropathology functioned as predictors. This model allowed to test whether the relationship between education and cognitive performance was moderated by current degree of neuropathology. Significant interactions were further examined using simple slope analysis from the interactions package in R (Bauer and Curran, 2005). Briefly, the relationship between education and cognitive performance was plotted as a function of different degrees of relative neuropathological burden: lower levels of neuropathology (−1 standard deviation (SD)], average neuropathology (0 SD), and higher levels of neuropathology (+ 1 SD).

Furthermore, we performed *sensitivity* analyses to investigate whether our results were influenced by using *standardized norm scores* to calculate the cognitive domain scores, as norm scores provide an indication of cognitive performance relatively to an individual’s age, sex and/or educational level. Norm scores were computed using a large Dutch normative database from the Advanced Neuropsychological Diagnostics Infrastructure (ANDI; de Vent et al., 2016). As normative data for the FAB were unavailable in ANDI, these norm scores were generated using another normative database (Coen et al., 2016). Moreover, given that floor performance on the TMT ratio scores and delayed recall of the 8-Word Test occurred more frequently in AD and MCI relatively to SCD (see Supplementary Table A), we also repeated our analyses while deriving the *compound scores without* these particular (sub-)tests. In addition, we investigated whether the effects of the neuropathological compound score were driven by a particular MRI rating (MTA, GA, or WMH). Therefore, we repeated our *analysis using either MTA, GA, or WMH* in the interaction term and *corrected for the other neuropathological features* (e.g., interaction between education and MTA, additionally correcting for GA and WMH).

For each linear regression model, *all variables were scaled* (i.e., z-normalized) *prior to the analysis*. Assumptions were checked using regression diagnostic plots and the gvlma package in R (Pena and Slate, 2006). None of the assumptions were violated (e.g., linearity, distribution of residuals, homoscedasticity).

All analyses were performed using R (version 3.6.11). Two-tailed p-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We report uncorrected p-values and FDR-corrected p-values to account for multiple comparisons across diagnoses and cognitive domains. We calculated Cohen’s f2 to indicate the effect sizes for our effects of interest (0.02 = small, 0.15 = medium, 0.35 = large; Cohen, 2013). Data visualization was performed using the raincloudplots and sjPlot packages in R (Allen et al., 2021; Lüdecke, 2021).

### Results
- Calculate education variance
	- If you only have the proportions of each level of the ordinal variable and not the actual values, you can still calculate an estimate of the variance using the following formula: 
		- Variance = [P(1-P) * (n1-1) + P(2-P) * (n2-1) + P(3-P) * (n3-1)] / (n-1) 
			-   P is the weighted mean proportion of the variable, calculated as: P = (n1p1 + n2p2 + n3p3) / n, where n1, n2, and n3 are the sample sizes of each level, and p1, p2, and p3 are the proportions of each level.
			-   n is the total sample size.
			-   (n1-1), (n2-1), and (n3-1) are the degrees of freedom for each level.
	- For example, let's say you have a sample of 100 people, with the following proportions of education levels:
		-   Level 1 (high school diploma): 0.4
		-   Level 2 (bachelor's degree): 0.5
		-   Level 3 (master's degree or higher): 0.1
		- To calculate the variance, you would first calculate the weighted mean proportion:
		- P = (0.4 x 100 + 0.5 x 100 + 0.1 x 100) / 100 = 0.45

	- In this paper's example, for SCD
		- level low education=0.26
		- level average education=0.5
		- level high education=0.24
		- `P=(28*0.26+54*0.5+26*0.24)/108=0.375
		- `SD=sqrt(0.375*(1-0.375)*28+0.375*(2-0.375)*54+0.375*(3-0.375)*26)=8.066

Note that this formula is an approximation and assumes that the proportions are evenly distributed within each level. It may not be as accurate as calculating the variance using the actual values, but it can still provide a rough estimate of the variability of the ordinal variable.

### Intro
Background: Cognitive reserve is most commonly measured using socio-behavioural proxy variables. These variables are easy to collect, have a straightforward interpretation, and are widely associated with reduced risk of dementia and cognitive decline in epidemiological studies. However, the specific proxies vary across studies and have rarely been assessed in complete models of cognitive reserve (i.e. alongside both a measure of cognitive outcome and a measure of brain structure). Complete models can test independent associations between proxies and cognitive function in addition to the moderation effect of proxies on the brain-cognition relationship. Consequently, there is insufficient empirical evidence guiding the choice of proxy measures of cognitive reserve and poor comparability across studies.

Method: In a *cross-sectional* study, we assessed the validity of *5 common proxies* (education, occupational complexity, verbal intelligence, leisure activities, and exercise) and all possible combinations of these proxies in 2 separate community-dwelling older adult cohorts: The Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (*TILDA*; N = 313, mean age = 68.9 years, range = 54–88) and the Cognitive Reserve/Reference Ability Neural Network Study (*CR/RANN*; N = 234, mean age = 64.49 years, range = 50–80). Fifteen models were created with *3 brain structure variables* (grey matter volume, hippocampal volume, and mean cortical thickness) and *5 cognitive variables* (verbal fluency, processing speed, executive function, episodic memory, and global cognition).

Results: *No moderation effects were observed*. There were robust positive associations with cognitive function, independent of brain structure, for 2 individual proxies (verbal intelligence and education) and 16 composites (i.e. combinations of proxies). Verbal intelligence was statistically significant in all models. Education was significant only in models with executive function as the cognitive outcome variable. Three robust composites were observed in more than two-thirds of brain-cognition models: the composites of (1) occupational complexity and verbal intelligence, (2) education and verbal intelligence, and (3) education, occupational complexity, and verbal intelligence. However, no composite had larger average effects nor was more robust than *verbal intelligence alone*.

Neuropathology and measures of brain structure do not fully explain cognitive decline (1] nor age-related variation in cognitive function (2]. This is evident in the finding of normal cognitive function in individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) based on neuropathology (3, 4]. This well-established gap between brain and cognition may be explained by cognitive reserve (CR), wherein the effects of brain path- ology or ageing on cognitive function are moderated by an individual’s ability to efficiently or flexibly use the brain’s resources to cope with task demands (5].

Accurate measurement of CR could improve the detection of, and risk assessments for, age-related cognitive decline and AD (6] and improve the measurement of intervention efficacy in clinical trials and intervention studies by enabling researchers to effectively statistically control for CR (7]. Difficulties in measuring CR (8], however, limit this potential. The most direct measures of CR are likely to be obtained using functional neuro- imaging (8]. CR may be measured with functional MRI using resting-state and task-based functional connectiv- ity. For example, a pattern of greater change in func- tional connectivity from resting-state in response to task demands is associated with better cognitive performance, above and beyond the effects of cortical thickness (9]. However, the considerable cost of MRI scanning (10] limits access to such measures, particularly in lower in- come countries 11]. As such, socio-behavioural vari- ables reflecting the degree of exposure to, or engagement in, various lifetime experiences are often used as proxies of CR 8].

The rationale for using proxies is that greater exposure to certain lifetime experiences increases the adaptability of cognitive and functional brain processes, thereby enabling a greater ability to cope with brain changes or damage 8]. Considerable epidemiological evidence indicates a reduced risk and/or delayed onset of dementia and cognitive decline in individuals with greater educational attainment 12–14], occupational complexity/sta- tus 15–17], literacy and/or verbal intelligence 18–21], engagement in activities that were cognitively stimulating 22, 23], leisure-related 24, 25], physical 22, 26–28], and social 22, 23, 29]. Proxies also provide a single value with a simple interpretation—a higher degree of exposure reflects greater CR. Moreover, proxies are easy and inexpensive to obtain, and some, such as educational attainment, are routinely collected as part of most ageing studies. It is therefore not surprising that CR is most often measured using proxies 30].

Despite their advantages, the use of proxies to measure CR has been criticized. First, some proxies, such as educational attainment, are typically static measures 31] despite the fact that CR is considered to be a dynamic construct that can change over time 32]. Second, some argue that a single proxy fails to reflect the full CR con- struct which is thought to be influenced by a range of experiences 33, 34]. Finally, proxies may also be associ- ated with cognitive decline via mechanisms other than reserve 35]. For instance, greater educational attainment is correlated with higher socioeconomic status 36] which is itself associated with slower cognitive decline 37] and reduced risk and prevalence of dementia 38, 39]. Low socioeconomic status is associated with various other factors, including stress and access to healthcare, which could exacerbate cognitive decline 38]. As such, the protective effect of education on cognitive decline and dementia (but cf. 40] for an alternative perspective) may be via mechanisms related to socioeconomic status, rather than CR 41].

The limitations of individual proxies may be mitigated by averaging (cf. transformation methods such as principal component analysis) multiple proxies to create a composite proxy measure that still provides a single summary value with a simple interpretation 42–46]. Composite proxies allow for a wider range of contributions to CR and enable the inclusion of dynamic proxies that can change over time, such as verbal intelligence or engagement in activities 31]. Furthermore, composite proxies may attenuate the issue of non-CR mechanisms of individual proxies be- cause alternative mechanisms (e.g. socioeconomic sta- tus) might only be associated with some proxies, such as educational attainment, but not others like social engagement. Some composite-type approaches, includ- ing factor analytic and latent variable models, measure CR using inappropriate reflective measurement models, where the observed CR proxies are effectively considered to be reflective (i.e. caused by) the latent CR construct 35]. Composite proxies are a more ap- propriate formative measurement model, where the observed proxies are considered to form, or cause, CR. Moreover, this approach can reflect the unique additive contributions of individual proxies, whereas factor analytic models reflect only the shared variance across different proxies 8].

While the composite approach offers advantages over the use of single proxies, there is no agreed-upon gold- standard composite proxy 30] just as there is likewise no gold-standard individual proxy. Similarly, it is unclear which proxy should be used when assessing candidate neuroimaging measures of CR, as face validity is assessed via their association with CR proxies 47, 48]. The con- siderable variation 49, 50] and lack of coherence in the use of proxies means that there is poor comparability across studies, as an effect observed for one proxy (e.g. educational attainment) may not be observed to the same degree for another (e.g. occupational complexity), even though both putatively reflect CR. It also provides researchers in the field of CR with an additional “re- searcher degrees of freedom” 51] such that several dif- ferent proxies could be examined but only statistically significant results are reported.

To assess the validity of a potential measure of CR, a complete model of CR is required, which includes 3 components: a measure of CR (e.g. a proxy), a measure of brain structure/pathology, and a measure of cognitive function 8, 52]. This enables the assessment of the cog- nitive benefit criterion 48]. This criterion can be satis- fied via the observation of (1) an “independent effect” in which the candidate measure is positively associated with cognitive function, independent of brain structure, or (2) a “moderation effect” in which the candidate measure moderates the relationship between brain struc- ture and cognitive function 8, 47]. The moderation ef- fect is considered the ideal benchmark for CR, whereas the independent effect is considered a weaker level of evidence for a CR effect 8].

A systematic review of CR proxies from complete CR models reported inconclusive evidence for educational attainment, occupational complexity/status, and leisure activity as proxies of CR in cognitively healthy cohorts 53]. A single reviewed study provided evidence that greater engagement in cognitively stimulating activities in mid- and late-life provided CR effects 54]. Other proxies were not assessed in this systematic review, al- though individual studies have reported positive evi- dence for CR effects in complete CR models. Verbal intelligence has been positively associated with cognition, controlling for global AD neuropathology or hippo- campal atrophy in cognitively healthy 55, 56] and cognitively impaired older adults 55]. Physical activity was positively associated with cognition in the presence of neuropathology 57] but not hippocampal atrophy 56]. Social engagement moderated the relationship be- tween amyloid-beta deposition and cognitive decline 58]. The composite of verbal intelligence and education moderated the relationship of subcortical grey matter (GM) volume and cortical thickness with fluid reasoning but not memory or processing speed and attention 46].

This composite was also associated with memory controlling for GM volume 59] and global cognition controlling for a composite AD-biomarker 45]. Although other composites have been associated with cognition 50], there is very little empirical evidence regarding their effects within complete CR models.

There is currently no conclusive evidence for the best individual or composite proxy for measuring or validating neuroimaging measures of CR, particularly with re- spect to cognitively healthy older adults. A methodology for solving this problem is the use of hierarchical linear moderated regressions to systematically assess standard CR proxies and their composites in complete models, an approach that enables the examination of both moderation and independent effects within the same analysis framework. This is important because, although moderation effects should ideally be observed to validate a CR proxy or measure 8], they are typically small in real- world data 60], explaining 1–3% of the variance in the outcome 61]. Consequently, large sample sizes are required to detect typically small moderation effects 62]. This issue is further exacerbated when measurement error is present in either variable in the interaction term (e.g. the CR proxy and measure of brain structure) used to assess the moderation effect 63] or when either vari- able in the interaction term is associated with the out- come variable (e.g. cognitive function 64];). Given the noted difficulties in identifying moderation effects, it is important to also consider the independent effect when assessing the validity of CR proxies.

*Hierarchical linear regressions* allow the robustness (i.e. frequency of effects using different measures of brain structure and cognitive function) and magnitude of both moderation and independent effects of different proxies to be compared. Here, in two separate community-dwelling older adult cohorts, we examined five common putative CR proxies—education, occupational complexity, verbal intelligence, leisure activities, and exercise—and all of their possible combinations. We included three brain structure variables, mean cortical thickness, hippocampal volume, and grey matter volume, in each model. Our primary aim was to identify the CR proxies with the most robust and largest effects across two datasets. More formally, we define effective CR proxies as those variables that have a significant independent or moderation effect on measures of cognitive function and brain structure.

The **first dataset** consisted of data from *313 community- dwelling adults* (mean age = 68.90 years, SD = 6.75 years, range = 54–88years; 50.48% female), a subset of *The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA)*, and a nationally representative longitudinal cohort study of older adults in Ireland 64, 65]. This data was collected during Wave 3 of the TILDA study 66]. All participants were screened for MRI contraindications, and study- specific *inclusion criteria* included no history of neurological conditions and available data for CR proxies and cognitive function. The **second dataset** consisted of data from *234 community-dwelling adults* (mean age = 64.49 years, SD = 7.42 years, range = 50–80 years; 51.28% female) selected from participants in the *Cognitive Reserve/Reference Ability Neural Network (CR/RANN)* studies 67– 69]. Participants were screened for MRI contraindications, hearing and visual impairments, medical or psychiatric conditions, and dementia or MCI. Participants selected for the current analyses were aged 50 years or older with data available for CR proxies, cognitive function, and MRI. Data was available for 5 socio-behavioural proxies in both datasets: educational attainment, occupational complexity, verbal intelligence, leisure activities, and physical activity. In TILDA, further data was available for the proxies: cognitively stimulating activities and social engagement.

**Educational** attainment was measured using *years of formal education* in both datasets. In TILDA, participants were asked to indicate the age at which they first left continuous full-time education. This information was missing for 4 participants in the final sample (1.28%), so it was imputed using educational qualification, father’s education, age, sex, and rural residence during childhood as previously described 70]. Occupational complexity was measured using the complexity of work in the dimensions of data, people, and things 71] using ratings obtained from an online cata- logue of the Dictionary of Occupational Tiles (DOT: www.occupationalinfo.org). Ratings for each dimension were reversed (such that higher scores reflected greater complexity) and then summed to create a total occupational complexity score, with scores ranging from 0 (minimal complexity) to 21 (maximal complexity). This was obtained for each participant’s current occupation or last occupation before retirement in TILDA and for participant’s occupation of longest duration of their lifetime in CR/RANN. Verbal intelligence was measured using the total number of correctly pronounced words on the National Adult Reading Test (NART; Nelson and Willinson 72]) in TILDA and the American National Adult Reading Test (AMNART; Grober and Sliwinski 73]) in CR/ RANN. In TILDA, a stress/anxiety-preventative and time-saving measure 74] was employed such that participants only completed the second half of the NART if they scored greater than 20 on the first half. A correction procedure was employed whereby scores of 0–11 were retained as full scores, but scores of 12–20 in participants who did not complete the second half were corrected using a conversion table outlined by Beardsall and Brayne 75, 76]. Possible scores on the NART, in TILDA, ranged from 0 to 50 and on the AMNART, in CR/RANN, from 0 to 45. While the NART is often used to provide a measure of premorbid intelligence, we have labelled NART scores here as verbal intelligence in line with previous cognitive reserve studies 42, 77]. The NART is “effectively a test of knowledge acquisition” 78] that may reflect the exposure to various educational and cognitive experiences across the lifespan 79–82]. Leisure activities were assessed in TILDA by partici- pants rating their current frequency of engagement on an 8-point Likert scale (0 = never to 7 = daily/almost daily) in 9 activities: watching television, going to films/ plays/concerts, travel, listening to music/radio, going to the pub, eating out, sports/exercise, visiting/talking on phone, and volunteering. In CR/RANN, participants rated their frequency of engagement over the preceding 6months on a 3-point Likert scale (1 = never to 3 = often) in 17 activities: television/radio, cards/games, reading, lectures/concerts, theatre/movies, travel, walks/ rides, crafts/hobbies, music, visiting, sports/dancing/exercise, cooking, group membership, collecting, religious activities, and volunteering. For both datasets, total scores were created by summing individual responses and possible scores ranged from 17 to 51. Physical activity was assessed in TILDA by calculating the total metabolic minutes arising from self-reported physical activity over the last week using the Inter- national Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF; Craig et al. 83]; Lee et al. 84]). This questionnaire assessed the time spent in 3 categories: vigorous, moderate, and walking. Responses were converted to metabolic equivalent minutes 83] and summed. In CR/RANN, physical activity was calculated using total metabolic hours arising from physical activity in an aver- age week. The Godin leisure-time exercise questionnaire 85] assessed the frequency of activity sessions lasting > 15 min in 3 categories: strenuous, moderate, and mild exercise. Responses were then weighted by the average estimated duration of activity in each category (0.5, 0.75, and 1h, respectively) and their metabolic equivalent values (9, 5, 3; Ogino et al., 28]; Scarmeas et al. 86]). Cognitively stimulating activities were assessed in TILDA with a questionnaire where participants rated their frequency of engagement on an 8-point Likert scale (0 = never to 7 = daily/almost daily) in 5 activities: at- tending classes and lectures, working in the garden/home or on a car, reading books/magazines, spending time on hobbies/creative activities, and playing cards/bingo/ games. Total scores were created by summing individual responses and possible scores ranged from 0 to 35. Social engagement was measured in TILDA using the Social Network Index 87] which provides a total score, ranging from 0 to 4, reflecting an individual’s degree of social connection 88]. Composite proxies were created by first standardizing (z-scoring) individual proxies. Next, every unique combination of proxies was generated and the composite proxy was the average of those proxies. For TILDA, this produced 120 unique composite proxies. For CR/RANN, this resulted in 26 composite proxies. To summarize, for TILDA, there were 127 proxies in total (individual and composite) and 31 in total for CR/ RANN. To attenuate possible effects of outliers, all proxies were Winsorized using a robust technique based on the median absolute deviation 89]. Outliers were identified as values greater than a threshold of 3 median absolute deviations from the median. Identified outliers were replaced by the median ± 3 median absolute deviations.

**Verbal fluency** was assessed using the total score on the Animal Naming Test which measures the ability to spontaneously produce the name of animals in 1 min 74]. The total number of animals named was used as the total score in both datasets.

**Processing speed** was measured using the time to complete the Colour Trails Task 1 (CTT 1; D’Elia et al. 90]) in TILDA and the Trail Making Task A (TMT A; Reitan 91]) in CR/RANN. The CTT is considered a cross-culturally valid form of the TMT 74]. Scores were *reversed* coded, such that *higher* scores reflected *greater cognitive* performance.

**Executive function** was assessed using the CTT 2 (D’Elia et al. 90]) in TILDA and the TMT B (Reitan 91]) in CR/RANN. Both measures reflect the multi- dimensional executive function construct 92, 93], specifically visual attention and cognitive flexibility with contributions from processing speed as well 74]. The time taken to complete both tasks was used as the outcome measure. Scores were reverse coded such that higher scores reflected greater cognitive performance.

**Episodic memory** was measured in both datasets with a composite measure created using the average of standardized and Winsorized immediate and delayed recall variables. In TILDA, immediate and delayed recall were measured using a 10-item word list 94] as used originally in the Health and Retirement Study 95]. The word list was assessed over 2 trials in TILDA and the average score for immediate and delayed recall from both trials was used. In CR/RANN, immediate and delayed recall were measured using the total and delayed recall scores from the Selective Reminding Test (SRT; Buschke and Fuld 96]).

**Global cognition** was measured using a composite measure of all 5 cognitive variables in each dataset: verbal fluency, processing speed, executive function, episodic memory (immediate recall), and episodic memory (delayed recall). Cognitive variables were Winsorized and *standardized* *prior* to creation of the *composite*. The composite variable was *then* Winsorized and *standardized itself*.

T1-weighted 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) scans were acquired in both datasets using a 3-T scanner (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems, The Netherlands). TILDA parameters: FOV = 240 × 240 × 162 mm3, matrix size = 288 × 288, slice thickness/gap = 0.9/0 mm, TR/TE = 6.7/3.1 ms. CR/RANN parameters: FOV = 256 × 256 × 180mm3, matrix size = 256 × 256, slice thickness/gap = 1/0 mm, TR/TE = 6.5/3 ms. T1-MRIs were inspected and processed in TILDA and CR/RANN using FreeSurfer v6.0 and v5.1 97], respectively, as described previously 68, 98]. **Total GM volume and hippocampal volume** were obtained from Freesurfer and both were divided by Freesurfer’s estimated total intracranial volume. Brain images were parcellated using the Desikan Killiany atlas, with 34 cortical regions of interest (ROIs) per hemisphere 99]. The mean cortical thickness of each cortical ROI was calculated. Overall cortical thickness was calculated as the mean over cortical ROIs. All variables were *standardized and Winsorized* (based on z-scores > |3|). These three measures were selected based on their availability across both datasets and because they have been used in previous studies, with complete CR models, to represent brain structure: GM volume 100, 101], hippocampal volume 102, 103], and mean cortical thickness 9, 43, 104].

Fifteen individual brain structure-cognitive function models were created for each combination of brain structure and cognitive function variable, where one brain structure variable was selected as an independent variable and one cognitive function variable was selected as an outcome variable (Fig. 1). A moderated hierarchical regression (Fig. 1) was conducted within each brain structure-cognitive function model (n = 15) for each unique proxy (TILDA = 127; CR/RANN = 31). In step 1, a cognitive measure was regressed on age, sex, and a measure of brain structure. In step 2, a proxy variable (Fig. 2) was included as an independent variable. *In step 3*, the *interaction* term for brain structure and the proxy was added. To protect against violations of linear regression assumptions, the analysis was repeated using a robust regression, specifically an iteratively reweighted least squares regression with Tukey’s biweight function and median absolute deviation scaling. Effects within each dataset were only considered significant if they were statistically significant in both the linear regression and robust regression. To control for multiple comparisons and to ensure generalizability of findings, effects were only considered significant if they were statistically significant across both datasets. The analysis was conducted with customized Python code (available here: https://github.com/rorytboyle/hierarchical_regression) which used the statsmodels module 105]. The change in R2 (i.e. amount of variance explained) from step 1 to step 2 and from step 2 to step 3 in linear regression models was used to assess the size of the independent and moderation effects of CR proxies, respectively. Where significant effects were observed, the mean R2 change across both datasets was calculated to assess the average additional variance explained by the proxy and its interaction with brain structure.

Step 3: Moderation effects

There were no significant moderation effects, in either dataset for any proxy, on the association between brain structure—as measured by GM volume, hippocampal volume, or mean cortical thickness—and cognition. Negative moderation effects are consistent with the CR hypothesis because they reflect weaker associations be- tween brain structure and cognition in individuals with higher CR, suggesting that individuals with higher CR are less reliant on brain structure to sustain cognitive function. Thirty-one non-replicated negative moderation effects (i.e. consistent with the CR hypothesis) were ob- served in TILDA (see Additional file 4, Table S1), but none survived correction for multiple comparisons (Bon- ferroni-adjusted alpha = 0.0004: alpha [0.05]/compari- sons per model [106]). 61.29% of these effects were observed for composite proxies including cognitively stimulating activities, which was not available in CR/ RANN. No negative moderation effects were observed in CR/RANN. 在任何代理的两个数据集中，大脑结构（通过 GM 体积、海马体积或平均皮质厚度测量）与认知之间的关联没有显着的调节作用。 负调节效应与 CR 假设一致，因为它们反映了具有较高 CR 的个体大脑结构与认知之间较弱的关联，表明具有较高 CR 的个体较少依赖大脑结构来维持认知功能。 在 TILDA 中观察到 31 个非重复的负调节效应（即与 CR 假设一致）（见附加文件 4，表 S1），但没有一个在多重比较校正后幸存下来（Bonferroni 调整的 alpha = 0.0004： alpha [0.05]/每个模型的比较 [106]）。 这些效果中的 61.29% 是针对包括认知刺激活动在内的复合代理观察到的，这在 CR/RANN 中是不可用的。 在 CR/RANN 中没有观察到负面的调节作用。

Positive moderation effects contradict the CR hypothesis as they reflect stronger associations between brain structure and cognition in individuals with higher CR, suggesting that individuals with higher CR are more reliant on brain structure to sustain cognitive function. Non-replicated positive moderation effects (i.e. contra- dicting the CR hypothesis) were observed in both data- sets (see Additional file 4, Table S2), but none survived correction for multiple comparisons. Eight effects were observed in TILDA (Bonferroni-adjusted alpha = 0.0004) and seven effects were observed in CR/RANN (Bonfer- roni-adjusted alpha = 0.0016: alpha [0.05]/comparisons per model [31]). The Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons applied here are liberal as they correct for the number of proxies compared per brain-cognition model (TILDA 127, CR/RANN 31) rather than the num- ber of total comparisons across all proxies and all brain- cognition models (TILDA 1905; CR/RANN 465).正调节效应与 CR 假说相矛盾，因为它们反映了具有较高 CR 的个体的大脑结构与认知之间更强的关联，表明具有较高 CR 的个体更依赖大脑结构来维持认知功能。 在两个数据集中都观察到了非复制的正调节效应（即与 CR 假设相矛盾）（参见附加文件 4，表 S2），但没有一个在多重比较校正后幸存下来。 在 TILDA 中观察到八种效应（Bonferroni 调整后的 alpha = 0.0004），在 CR/RANN 中观察到七种效应（Bonferroni 调整后的 alpha = 0.0016：alpha [0.05]/每个模型的比较 [31]）。 此处应用的多重比较的 Bonferroni 校正是自由的，因为它们校正了每个大脑认知模型（TILDA 127，CR/RANN 31）比较的代理数量，而不是所有代理和所有大脑认知的总比较数量 型号（TILDA 1905；CR/RANN 465）。

## K. Ko 2022. Cognitive reserve proxies, Alzheimer pathologies, and cognition (2022)
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/5.%20Cognitive%20reserve%20proxies,%20Alzheimer%20pathologies,%20and%20cognition.pdf)
### Intro
This study aimed to explore the moderating effects of the frequently used cognitive reserve (CR) proxies (i.e., education, *premorbid intelligence quotient (pIQ)*, *occupational complexity (OC)*, and *lifetime cognitive activity (LCA)*) on the relationships between various in vivo Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathologies and cognition. In total, 351 (268 cognitively unimpaired (CU), 83 cognitive impaired (CI)) older adults underwent multi-modal brain imaging to measure AD pathologies and cognitive assessments, and information on CR proxies was obtained. For overall participants, only education moderated the relationship between Aβ deposition and cognition. Education, pIQ, and LCA, but not OC, showed moderating effect on the relationship between AD-signature cerebral hypometabolism and cognition. In contrast, only OC had a moderating effect on the relationship between cortical atrophy of the AD-signature regions and cognition. Such moderation effects of the CR proxies were similarly observed in CI individuals, but most of them were not in CU individuals. The findings suggest that the proposed CR proxies have different moderating effects on the relationships between specific AD pathologies and cognition.

The concept of cognitive reserve (CR) has been introduced to explain how some people can tolerate more brain pathologies or age-related brain changes than others (Stern, 2002). It is defined as the capacity to preserve cognitive function better in the presence of brain pathology and it acts as a moderator between brain changes and the degree of cognitive impairment (Stern, 2012, 2002; Stern et al., 2018). Various measures have been proposed as proxies of CR, including education, the premorbid intelligence quo- tient (pIQ), occupational complexity (OC), and lifetime cognitive activity (LCA), and have been used to estimate the CR of an individual indirectly (Arenaza-Urquijo et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2011).

Among CR proxies, education was reported to moderate the relationships of Aβ senile plaques (Bennett et al., 2005, 2003), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Aβ) (Yaffe et al., 2011), cerebral Aβ-positive status on positron emission tomography (PET) (Roe et al., 2008), or medial temporal atrophy on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (Perneczky et al., 2009) with cognitive function, but not that of neurofibrillary tangles (Bennett et al., 2005, 2003) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology composite (Bauer et al., 2020). 2 studies showed that pIQ, estimated using an adult reading test, interacted with inferior temporal tau deposition (Rentz et al., 2017) and precuneus Aβ deposition on PET (Rentz et al., 2010) to predict cognitive function, while another study suggested that pIQ does not moderate the relationship of various AD biomarkers with cognition, including CSF Aβ, t-tau, and structural abnormalities on MRI (Vemuri et al., 2011). A study showed that composite measure of education and occupation was associated with baseline cognitive performance but did not moder- ate Aβ-related cognitive decline in cognitively normal older adults (Vemuri et al., 2015). However, no study has yet investigated the independent moderating effects of OC and LCA on the relationship between AD pathologies and cognition.

Therefore, we explored the moderating effects of education, pIQ, OC, and LCA on the relationships between various in vivo AD pathologies and global cognition to compare their appropriateness as CR proxies for specific pathologies. We used 3 AD neuroimaging biomarkers to measure different in vivo AD pathologies: cerebral Aβ deposition on 11C-Pittsburg compound B *(PiB)- PET*, AD-signature region cerebral *glucose metabolism* (*AD-CM*) on 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose *(FDG)-PET*, and AD-signature region *cortical thickness (AD-CT)* on structural brain MRI (Jack et al., 2018, 2016).

This study is part of the *Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early Diagnosis and Prediction of AD* (KBASE), an ongoing prospective cohort study designed to identify novel AD biomarkers and to investigate various lifetime experiences contributing to AD-related brain changes. Details on the KBASE study have been described previously (Byun et al., 2017). The current study included 351 middle-aged and older individuals with age between 55 and 90 years. The participants consisted of 232 cognitively unimpaired (CU) with no Aβ deposition on PiB-PET (CU-), 36 CU with Aβ deposition (CU+), 44 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with Aβ deposition (MCI+), 39 AD dementia with Aβ deposition (ADD+). CU individuals had no diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, and a global *Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)* score of 0 (Lee et al., 2002; Morris, 1993). All individuals with MCI met the current consensus *criteria for amnestic MCI*, which are as follows: (1) memory complaints confirmed by an informant, (2) objective memory impairments, (3) preserved global cognitive function, (4) independence in functional activities, and (5) no dementia. Regarding criterion 2, the age-, education-, and sex adjusted z-scores for at least 1 of 4 episodic memory tests was <-1.5. The 4 memory tests were the Word List Memory, Word List Recall, Word List Recognition, and Constructional Recall tests, which are included in the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological assessment battery (Lee et al., 2004, 2002). All individuals with MCI had a CDR score of 0.5. All individuals with *AD dementia* meet both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (*DSM-IV*) criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) for dementia and National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association (*NIA-AA*) criteria (McKhann et al., 2011) for probable AD dementia, and had a global *CDR score* of 0.5 or 1. Individuals with medical, psychiatric, or neurological conditions or a history of conditions that may affect brain structures or functions, such as stroke, head trauma, depression, hydrocephalus, or focal brain lesions on MRI were excluded. Each participant was diagnosed at a consensus conference of board-certified psychiatrists and neuropsychologists before inclusion in the study. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospi- tal and Seoul National University-Seoul Metropolitan Government Boramae Center (Seoul, South Korea) and conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the current version of the Declara- tion of Helsinki. All participants or their caregivers gave informed consent to participate in this study.

All participant underwent *comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessments* following the KBASE assessment protocol (Byun et al., 2017), which incorporated the Korean version of the *CERAD assessment* packet (Lee et al., 2004, 2002). CERAD-total score (CERAD-TS) (Chandler et al., 2005; Seo et al., 2010), which is calculated by summing the scores of 6 tests included in the CERAD neuropsychological battery (i.e., Semantic Verbal Fluency Tasks, 15- item Boston Naming Test, Word List Memory, Word List Recall, Word List Recognition, and Constructional Praxis), was used as an established composite measure of **global cognition**. CERAD-TS has a maximum of 100 points.

The years of formal education, pIQ, OC, and LCA participation frequency were included as candidate **CR proxies**. *Years of formal education* was self-reported by the participants and confirmed by reliable informants. Formal education was defined as “education which takes place in education and training institutions, leading to recognized diplomas or qualifications” (Commission of the Euro- pean Communities, 2000). pIQ was estimated by the performance on the Korean Adult Reading Test (Yi et al., 2017), a word-reading test for Korean-speaking adults using 50 irregularly pronounced words that is useful for estimating premorbid intelligence. The Korean Adult Reading Test-predicted Full-Scale IQ, derived from the Korean Adult Reading Test error score, was used as the pIQ of an individual. Information about occupation was self-reported by the participant and confirmed by reliable informants. Only the longest-held occupation was considered. We then classified OC into 4 levels based on the skill levels described in the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08) (Darwish et al., 2018; International Labor Office (ILO), 2012). Occupations at skill level 1 typically involve the simple and routine physical or man- ual tasks (e.g., office cleaners, freight handlers or garden laborers). Occupations at skill level 2 typically involve the performance of tasks, such as operating machinery and electronic equipment; driv- ing vehicles; maintenance and repair of electrical and mechanical equipment; and manipulation, ordering and storage of information (e.g., butchers, bus drivers or secretaries). Occupations classified at skill level 3 typically involve the performance of complex techni- cal and practical tasks that require complex problem solving, rea- soning, and decision making in a specialized field (e.g., shop man- agers, medical laboratory technicians or diagnostic medical radio- graphers). Occupations classified at skill level 4 typically involve the performance of tasks that require complex problem-solving, decision-making and creativity based on an extensive body of the- oretical and factual knowledge in a specialized field (e.g., sales and marketing managers, civil engineers or secondary school teach- ers). The LCA participation frequency was measured with a 39- item structured questionnaire (Wilson et al., 2007). The included items were relatively common activities with few barriers to par- ticipation, such as reading newspapers, magazines, or books; vis- iting a museum or library; attending a concert, play, or musical; writing letters; and playing games. The frequency of participation was rated from 1 (once a year or less) to 5 (approximately daily). There were nine items for current, 11 items for childhood (6–12 years of age), 10 items for young adulthood (18 years of age), and nine items for midlife (40 years of age) cognitive activities. Item scores for childhood, young adulthood, and midlife periods were averaged to yield a separate value for the corresponding age pe- riod. We then calculated the composite LCA score to use in the subsequent analysis, which was an average of the 3 epoch values. The items for current activities were not included to calculate LCA score to avoid the influence of current cognitive impairment state on LCA score.

All participants underwent simultaneous 3-dimensional [11C]- **PiB-PET** and T1-weighted MRI using a 3.0 T Biograph mMR scanner (Siemens; Washington DC, WC, USA), according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. After intravenous administration of 555 MBq of [11C] PiB (range, 450-610 MBq), a 30-minute emission scan was obtained 40 minutes after injection. The PiB-PET data collected in list mode were processed for routine corrections such as uniformity, UTE-based attenuation, and decay corrections, and were reconstructed into a 256 × 256 image matrix using iterative methods (6 iterations with 21 subsets). The details of PiB-PET acquisition and preprocessing were described previously (Park et al., 2019). An automatic anatomic labeling algorithm and a region-combining method (Reiman et al., 2009) were applied to determine the *regions of interest (ROIs)* for characterizing the PiB retention levels in the frontal, lateral parietal, posterior cingulate–precuneus, and lateral temporal regions. The *standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR)* value for each ROI was calculated by dividing the mean value for all voxels within each ROI by the mean cerebellar grey matter uptake value for the same image. A global cortical ROI consisting of the 4 ROIs was also defined and a global Aβ retention value was generated by dividing the mean value for all voxels of the global cortical ROI by the mean cerebellar uptake value in the same image (Choe et al., 2014; Reiman et al., 2009). Each participant was classified as Aβ-positive if the SUVR value was > 1.4 in at least 1 of 4 ROIs or as Aβ-negative if the SUVR values of all 4 ROIs was ≤ 1.4 (Jack et al., 2014; Reiman et al., 2009). 

All participants underwent [18F]-FDG-PET imaging using the machine described above. The participants fasted for at least 6 hours and rested in a waiting room for 40 minutes prior to the scans after intravenous administration of 0.1 mCi/Kg of [18F] FDG radioligands. The PET data collected in list mode (5 minutes x 4 frames) were processed for routine corrections such as uniformity, UTE-based attenuation, and decay corrections. The details ofFDG-PET acquisition and preprocessing were described previously (Park et al., 2019). AD-signature FDG ROIs, such as the angular gyri, posterior cingulate cortex, and inferior temporal gyri, which are sensitive to the changes associated with AD (Jack et al., 2014), were  determined. *AD-CM* was defined as the *voxel-weighted mean SUVR* extracted from the AD-signature FDG ROIs.

All T1-weighted MR images were acquired in the sagittal orientation using the same PET-MR machine. The parameters were as follows: repetition time = 1670 ms, echo time = 1.89 ms, field of view 250 mm, and 256 × 256 matrix with 1.0 mm slice thick- ness. MRI acquisition and preprocessing were described previously (Park et al., 2019). AD-CT was defined as the mean *cortical thickness* obtained from AD-signature regions, including the inferior frontal sulcus, superior frontal gyrus, temporal pole, inferior tem- poral gyrus, medial temporal cortex, precuneus, superior parietal lobule, angular gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus, based on Desikan- Killany atlas (Desikan et al., 2006; Dickerson et al., 2009).

To analyze the associations of CR proxies each other, Kendall’s tau correlation was conducted due to non-normal distribution of CR proxies. To analyze the moderating effects of the CR proxies on the relationships between in vivo AD pathologies and cognition, we performed multiple linear regression models with CERAD-TS as the dependent variable, each CR proxy, each AD neuroimaging biomarker, and CR proxy × AD neuroimaging biomarker interaction term as independent variables *controlling for age, sex, and apolipoprotein ε4 (APOE4)* carrier status. Additonal subgroup analyses were conducted for each of CU and cognitively impaired (CI: MCI plus AD dementia) group using the same models, consid- ering that the effect of CR measured by proxy variable may dif- ferently observed by cognitive status (Pettigrew and Soldan, 2019; Soldan et al., 2017; Stern, 2012). All analyses were done with SPSS 23.0 (IBM Corporation, New York) and results were examined at p < 0.05.

### Intro
Dementia syndrome is one of the most devastating conditions in older adults. As treatments to stop neurodegeneration become available, accurate and timely diagnosis will increase in importance. One issue is that cognitive performance sometimes does not match the corresponding level of neuropathology, affecting diagnostic accuracy. Cognitive reserve (CR), which can preserve cognitive function despite underlying neuropathology, explains at least some variability in cognitive performance. We examined the influence of CR proxies (education and occupational position) on the relationship between hippocampal or total gray matter volume and cognition. We used data from the *Czech Brain Aging Study*. Participants were clinically confirmed to be without dementia (n = 457, including subjective cognitive decline and amnestic mild cognitive impairment) or with dementia syndrome (n = 113). For participants *without dementia*, higher education magnified the associations between (a) hippocampal volume and executive control (b = 0.09, p = 0.033), (b) total gray matter volume and language (b = 0.12, p < 0.001), and (c) total gray matter volume and memory (b = 0.08, p = 0.018). Similarly, higher occupational position magnified the association between total gray matter volume and (a) attention/working memory (b = 0.09, p = 0.009), (b) language (b = 0.13, p = 0.002), and (c) memory (b = 0.10, p = 0.013). For participants *with dementia*, the associations between hippocampal (b = –0.26, p = 0.024) and total gray matter (b = –0.28, p = 0.024) volume and visuospatial skills decreased in magnitude with higher education. We found that the association between brain volume and cognitive performance varies based on CR, with greater CR related to a stronger link between brain volume and cognition before, and a weaker link after, dementia diagnosis.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia syndrome in older adults (Alzheimer’s Association, 2022). The pathophysiological mechanisms thought to cause AD include impaired amyloid-beta and tau protein metabolism and neurodegeneration leading to regional and whole brain atrophy (according to the amyloid cascade hypothesis; Hardy and Higgins, 1992; Karran et al., 2011; Jack and Holtzman, 2013; Jack et al., 2013); however, it is known that clinical progression of the disease does not always align with levels of neuropathology load. Therefore, there can be a dichotomy between expected and observed cognitive performance based on level of neuropathology which raises the question of what additional factors may be contributing to the preservation of cognitive functions in older adults. Stern et al. (2020) discuss the concept of resilience, which is related to brain reserve, brain maintenance, and cognitive reserve, as an explanation for this dichotomy.

Cognitive reserve is an active mechanism thought to be influenced by lifetime experiences and achievements and explains better cognitive performance in the presence of neuropathology (Stern et al., 2020). Cognitive reserve is typically measured through sociobehavioral proxies (e.g., education or occupation) which are thought to contribute to reserve (Stern, 2002, 2009). Stern et al. (2020) suggest that an effective way to test the cognitive reserve hypothesis is through examining whether measures of reserve moderate the association between brain health and cognition.

Some studies have assessed how markers of cognitive reserve, such as education or occupation, moderate the relationship between AD-related neuropathology and cognitive outcomes but with discrepant findings. For example, in healthy older adults, higher educational attainment was associated with a weaker negative relationship between positron emission tomography (PET)-assessed amyloid-beta load and episodic memory performance (*Joannette et al., 2020*). However, higher education was also associated with a stronger positive relationship between hippocampal volume and delayed recall in healthy older adults (*O’Shea et al., 2018*). Similar divergent results have emerged in samples that included participants with cognitive impairment. For example, in a Dutch sample of older adults from a memory clinic that included participants with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia, there was a weaker positive relationship between medial temporal lobe volume and global cognitive abilities (i.e., greater volume/less atrophy related to better cognition) in more educated participants (*Staekenborg et al., 2020*). However, a study using data from a memory clinic in South Korea, which included participants with normal cognitive function, MCI, and dementia, reported that less right temporoparietal tau pathology and greater cortical thickness of the left inferior temporal gyrus were related to better memory performance—these relationships were stronger for individuals with higher cognitive reserve (a combination of education and work complexity) (*Lee et al., 2019*). Clearly, more research is needed to disentangle discrepancies between studies investigating cognitive reserve, brain health, and cognitive outcomes, especially within (rather than across) subgroups with the same cognitive status.

It is possible that these discrepant findings may result from the presence of a non-linear relationship between cognitive reserve, brain health markers, and cognitive outcomes. Evidence suggests that cognitive reserve interacts with cognitive performance and brain health differentially *depending on the cognitive status* of the sample being studied (e.g., healthy versus pathological aging; Menardi et al., 2018). Specifically, the interaction between brain health and cognition transitions from protective in healthy aging (i.e., higher cognitive reserve associated with better brain health) to compensatory in pathological aging (i.e., higher cognitive reserve associated with greater pathology; Menardi et al., 2018), but in both situations, higher cognitive reserve is associated with better cognitive performance. However, this explanation may be too simple since divergent findings regarding the moderating effect of cognitive reserve on brain health-cognition relationships have *been found in both healthy and pathological aging*.

Building on past research (O’Shea et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Joannette et al., 2020; Staekenborg et al., 2020), we investigated how two common proxies of cognitive reserve (education and occupational position) moderated the relationship between *brain health*, represented by *hippocampal* and total *gray matter volume*, and cognition in participants without dementia (i.e., subjective cognitive decline [SCD] and amnestic MCI [aMCI]) and with dementia syndrome. We modeled our approach after Joannette et al. (2020) who identified regions of significant moderations utilizing the Johnson–Neyman technique (Johnson and Fay, 1950), but with significant moderations probed via pre-defined groupings of cognitive reserve (Joannette et al., 2020). Since we used a *sample from a memory clinic* with *variation* in levels of clinical *impairment*, we may be able to detect at what point the relationship between brain volume and cognition becomes affected by markers of cognitive reserve. To extend past research that used only memory (O’Shea et al., 2018; Joannette et al., 2020) or general cognitive abilities (Staekenborg et al., 2020) as the cognitive outcome, we assessed a *full range of cognitive domains* in analyses.

The Czech Brain Aging Study (CBAS) is a longitudinal cohort study of patients in the Memory Clinic in Motol University Hospital and Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic (Sheardova et al., 2019). The participants were referred to the Memory Clinic by general practitioners, neurologists, or psychiatrists for self- and/or informant-reported cognitive complaints. The presented cross-sectional study utilized the cognitive testing and neuroimaging data from these participants, though other studies on laboratory and genetic results and spatial navigation exist. All participants provided informed consent. The Institutional Review Board of Motol University Hospital continually approves this research project.

A total of *873 individuals* had at least one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, forming the initial sample. Participants with greater than 6 months between their MRI scan and neuropsychological tests (n = 33), missing information on education (n = 9), occupational position (n = 77), or diagnosis (n = 22), who had a main lifetime occupation in the armed forces (n = 5), who had non-amnestic MCI (n = 84), or completed less than 50% of neuropsychological tests used to create each of the cognitive domains (n = 19) were *dropped*. To limit the sample to participants with mild dementia, participants diagnosed with dementia who did not have information about their Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) or who had a score less than 18 were dropped (n = 54). Therefore, the final analytic sample included* 570 participants* who were diagnosed without dementia (n = 457; including SCD (n = 149] and aMCI (n = 308]) or with dementia syndrome (n = 113). We included aMCI specifically since (a) it has been shown to relate more strongly to dementia progression than non-amnestic MCI (Peltz et al., 2011; Michaud et al., 2017), (b) it is the most common type of MCI, and (c) it is more likely associated with a neurodegenerative cause compared to non-amnestic MCI (Petersen et al., 2009).

Participants without dementia included individuals with clinical diagnoses of SCD or aMCI. SCD was defined as having normal objective cognitive performance, self-reported persistent cognitive complaints within the last 5 years in comparison with a previously normal status and being unrelated to an acute event, and having a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of ≤ 0.5 (Jessen et al., 2014). aMCI was defined as scoring ≥ 1.5 standard deviations below age- and education- adjusted neuropsychological test means in at least one of the memory tests, a CDR score ≤ 0.5, and cognitive complaints reported by the patient or a reliable informant (Petersen, 2004). Although aMCI was based mainly on neuropsychological tests, agreement within a multidisciplinary clinical team was required for the formal diagnosis, including a cognitive neurologist, clinical neuropsychologist, and psychometricians, taking into account the nature of the cognitive complaints and the patient’s medical history. To maintain parsimonious presentation of the results, we combined the two groups indicative of cognitive impairment (but without dementia)—SCD and aMCI. The decision to group SCD and aMCI is supported by the fact that individuals with SCD and aMCI are presumed to be on a cognitive continuum with at least some overlap whereby the two diagnoses have a tendency to fluctuate over time.

Dementia syndrome was diagnosed based on a consensus panel (Sheardova et al., 2019) using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Text Revision (DSM-IV- TR) guidelines (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). The progression to dementia and the etiology of dementia syndrome was established during the regular consensus meetings of neurologists and neuropsychologists. The diagnosis was mainly based on clinical history reported by the patient and the caregiver, neurological examination, and neuropsychological assessment. Brain MRI and PET scans were also considered when available. Most participants diagnosed with dementia syndrome had either AD (42%) or mixed dementia (40%) as their etiology, with other etiologies (e.g., vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies; 15%) or unavailable etiologies (4%) present in the remainder of the sample. The etiology of dementia syndrome was based on the current clinical criteria for probable AD (McKhann et al., 2011), probable vascular dementia (Román et al., 1993), probable dementia with Lewy bodies (McKeith et al., 2017), or probable behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (Rascovsky et al., 2011).

Neuropsychological tests were used to create cognitive domains by *standardizing scores on each test then averaging* the individual tests into a composite variable. Standardization was completed separately for participants with and without dementia; thus, participants’ performance on these tests would be compared against other participants in the same diagnostic group. 

Attention/working memory: This domain (α = 0.78) was assessed with four tests. We used Trail Making Test – Part A (TMT-A) with a maximum time of 180 s (Bezdicek et al., 2012). Participants who were unable to complete it within the given time frame were scored as 181 s. For analyses the score was reversed. The other tests included: Digit Symbol Coding Test, Digit Span – Forward (Digits-F), and Digit Span – Backward (Digits-B) from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – Revised (Wechsler, 1997), assessed with sub-scores (i.e., number of correct items).

Executive control: This domain (α = 0.62) was assessed with two tests: Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) with letters N, K, and P (Czech Republic Version) (Nikolai et al., 2015), and Trail Making Test – Part B (TMT-B) (Bezdicek et al., 2012). The maximum time for completion of the TMT-B was 300 s. However, those who were unable to complete it within the given time frame were scored as 301 s. For analyses the score was reversed.

Language: This domain (α = 0.84) was assessed with four tests: Boston Naming Test (BNT) (Goodglass et al., 1983), Verbal Fluency Test – Vegetables (VFT-V), Verbal Fluency Test – Animals (VFT-A) (Nikolai et al., 2015), and the Similarities subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – III (Wechsler, 1997).

Memory: This domain (α = 0.93) was assessed with four tests. Specifically, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test – Immediate Recall (AVLT-I; Sum of Trials 1-5) and Delayed Recall (AVLT- D) (Bezdicek et al., 2014), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test – Revised Immediate Recall (BVMTR-I; Sum of Trials 1–3) and Delayed Recall (BVMTR-D) (Benedict et al., 1996), and the Uniform Data Set Logical Memory Immediate Recall Test (Log- I) and Delayed Recall Test (Log-D) (Nikolai et al., 2018). The Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test Recall was a test of non- verbal memory (Osterrieth, 1944). The AVLT, BVMTR, and Log included both immediate and delayed components in one exam.

Visuospatial skills: This domain (α = 0.77) was assessed with two tests: Clock Drawing Test (Mazancova et al., 2017) (Cohen scoring system) and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test Copy (Meyers and Meyers, 1995).

MRI scans were acquired on a 1.5T scanner (Avanto; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using T1-weighted three- dimensional high-resolution magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with the following parameters: TR/TE/TI = 2000/3.08/1100 ms, flip angle 15◦, 192 continuous partitions, slice thickness 1.0 mm, and in-plane resolution 1 mm. Scans were visually examined by a neuroradiologist, blinded to the diagnosis, for sufficient technical quality and the absence of structural findings contradicting eligibility (Nedelska et al., 2012; Kerbler et al., 2015). MRI volumetry was processed using Freesurfer automated package (v5.3.01; Fischl et al., 2002). The current analyses focused on total hippocampal volume, which was calculated as the sum of the right and left hippocampal volumes, and total gray matter volume, both measured in cubic millimeters. Hippocampal volume and total gray matter volume were adjusted for estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV) to adjust for differences in head size (Voevodskaya et al., 2014). For analyses, eTIV-adjusted *volumes were converted to z-scores based on diagnostic groups* (i.e., participants without and with dementia).

Cognitive reserve proxies: Two cognitive reserve proxies were used in the current study. Education was measured as *years of formal education* (range: 8–27 years). Occupational position was coded by two independent raters according to the 2008 International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08; International Labour Office, 2012). The raters (JM, KV) were familiar with the data and native speakers of Czech language. The initial agreement was 87.5%. Coding for the remaining 12.5% of occupations was finalized during a consensus meeting between the two raters. Occupational position was coded based on main lifetime occupation; where unavailable (34.6%), last occupation was used. Participants were classified into one of the 10 categories represented by ISCO-08. Lower scores corresponded to higher occupational positions (1: managers, 2: professionals, 3: technicians and associate professionals, 4: clerical support workers, 5: services and sales workers, 6: skilled agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers, 7: craft and related trades workers, 8: plant and machine operators and assemblers, 9: elementary occupations, 0: armed forces workers). Due to the varied occupational positions that armed forces workers could align with, participants whose main lifetime occupation corresponded to armed forces workers were dropped from analyses. For analytic purposes, the ISCO-08 score was recoded such that higher scores were associated with higher occupational positions. *We assessed the relative strength of education and occupation as cognitive reserve proxies by conducting analyses using standardized variables (z-scores)*. For interpretation of interactions, we graphed the associations between brain volume and cognition for individuals with high (+1 SD from mean) and low (–1 SD from mean) cognitive reserve.

Covariates: Age (years), sex (male or female), and depressive symptoms as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version (Yesavage et al., 1982) (GDS-15; cutoff ≥ 5) served as **covariates**.

Descriptive statistics were used to describe the two groups. Independent sample t-tests or chi-square tests were used to assess differences between groups on the study variables. Separate regression analyses were conducted by diagnosis to examine the interrelation between brain volume (i.e., hippocampal or total gray matter volume), cognitive reserve proxies (education or occupational position), and cognition (five cognitive domains). Covariates included age, sex, and depressive symptoms. Since the relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive performance is complex (Butters et al., 2008) (e.g., depression could be a risk factor for, consequence of, or reaction to cognitive impairment), we also conducted analyses not controlling for depressive symptoms to determine the stability of effects. Additionally, as sex has been shown to influence reserve or resilience effects (Sundermann et al., 2016; Ewers, 2020; Subramaniapillai et al., 2021; Pa et al., 2022), we also conducted analyses stratified by sex.

We examined whether the cognitive reserve proxy variables moderated the relationship between brain volume and cognition. Significant interactions were probed with the Johnson-Neyman technique (Johnson and Fay, 1950) to identify “regions of significance,” that is, points at which there were significant moderated relationships between brain volume and cognition (Joannette et al., 2020). Significant interactions between brain volume and cognitive reserve proxies were graphed with high and low reserve corresponding to ±1 SD from the mean, respectively. Since main lifetime occupation represents the longest exposure to work environment and is therefore more likely to contribute to cognitive reserve than last occupation, we conducted sensitivity analyses restricting our sample to only participants who had data available on main lifetime occupation. All analyses were conducted using SAS software, Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Moderation analyses were conducted with the PROCESS Macro Version 3.4.1 in SAS (Hayes and Little, 2018). Significance was assessed with a two-tailed test at p < 0.05. In order to account for multiple comparisons, we used the Holm–Bonferroni Sequential Correction method (Holm, 1979) in a model-wise fashion such that the lowest p-value within a model was compared to the most stringent level of significance (p < 0.005) which was reduced iteratively for subsequent effects. Effects were considered significant if they fell below the level prespecified by the correction method.

We examined the moderating effect of cognitive reserve on the association between brain volume and common cognitive domains in participants without dementia (i.e., SCD and aMCI) and with dementia syndrome. Our results indicate that the effect of cognitive reserve on the relationship between brain volume and cognition *depends on* (a) what *diagnostic* group is under investigation, (b) what *cognitive domain* is included, and (c) what is used as the *proxy for cognitive reserve*. For participants already experiencing cognitive difficulties but who are still **free of dementia** (i.e., SCD and aMCI), we found some evidence of a *protective* effect of both education and occupational position, whereby among those with higher cognitive reserve, brain volume and cognitive performance (i.e., attention/working memory, executive control, language, and memory) were more closely related than among those with low cognitive reserve. Therefore, those with *high cognitive reserve* appeared to be *able to utilize available neural resources*, when still available despite existing cognitive problems, more efficiently than those with low reserve. Caution is warranted in interpreting these interactions as only the association between total gray matter volume and language was significantly moderated by education after correction for multiple comparisons was applied.

In participants **with dementia**, typically, high cognitive reserve (in those with high education and/or occupational position) is depleted to a great extent, as often reflected in greater neural loss and *accelerated decline* compared to patients with dementia with low reserve (Stern, 2002, 2009; Stern et al., 2020). This is described as a compensatory effect, where individuals with high reserve can compensate for neurodegeneration by using cognitive reserve related resources until these are no longer available due to overwhelming neuropathology, when dementia becomes clinically apparent. We found some evidence for this pre-dementia compensatory effect of cognitive reserve, whereby hippocampal volume and total gray matter volume were more beneficial to visuospatial skills among those with less education (Table 4). This may suggest that, after dementia diagnosis, individuals with low (but not high) education can still compensate for advancing neuropathology and perform relatively well when neural resources are available and poorly when they are not. In fact, illustration of the effects estimated separately for low and high education (Figure 2A) suggested that there was a negative association between greater hippocampal volume and poorer visuospatial skills for those with higher education specifically. This effect may be spurious as we would more likely expect a null effect and, in fact, these effects were reduced to null after correction for multiple comparisons. Alternatively, it may be that other biological factors besides hippocampal volume explain this effect. That is, visuospatial performance may be particularly impaired in those with high cognitive reserve (because of more extensive underlying neuropathology at/after dementia onset), but it may not be fully reflected in the measurement of volume alone.

Only participants with dementia in the mild to moderate stage of the syndrome were included, where memory impairment dominates. It may be that structures outside of the hippocampus drive differences in visuospatial performance. This explanation is also supported by the fact that the pattern of results seemed to be driven by low education in the total gray matter volume analyses. Age- and disease-related heterogeneity in gray matter atrophy exists (Fjell et al., 2014; Kang et al., 2019), so this global measure of brain integrity may reflect distinct atrophy patterns that could differentially influence visuospatial ability. Previously observed interactions between lifestyle factors, early life exposures, and biological mechanisms (Arenaza-Urquijo and Vemuri, 2018; de Rooij, 2022; Hoenig and Drzezga, 2022) indicate that complex interrelations between cognitive reserve and brain volume may result in different groups of reserve driving patterns found in different brain areas.

According to the cognitive reserve hypothesis (Stern, 2009), the relationship between brain integrity and cognitive performance differs depending on the clinical impairment under investigation. Specifically, individuals without cognitive impairment who have higher reserve can rely on preserved resources. Once clinical impairment sets in, there is a transition from still performing well with extensive neuropathology to the same individuals often exhibiting poorer cognitive performance due to greater underlying neuropathology which progressed to the point where cognitive functions are no longer protected. This relationship maps onto the mechanisms through which cognitive reserve is thought to operate—specifically, neural reserve and neural compensation (Stern, 2009).

Our results indicate that for participants without dementia (i.e., SCD and aMCI), (a) greater brain volume, whether hippocampal or total gray matter volume, was relatively consistently associated with better cognitive scores; (b) in terms of cognitive reserve proxies, both higher educational attainment and higher occupational position were related to better attention/working memory, executive control, language, and memory; and (c) the association between greater neural resources (i.e., hippocampal or total gray matter volume) and better cognitive scores was generally stronger among participants with greater cognitive reserve. Results from supplemental analyses restricted to participants with data available on main lifetime occupation were generally consistent with main analyses.

The significant moderations indicating a stronger relationship between brain volume and cognitive abilities for participants without dementia who had higher cognitive reserve suggest that individuals with higher education or occupational position are better capable of utilizing remaining neural resources to preserve cognitive performance. Particularly the moderation by education of the relationship between hippocampal volume and executive control is intriguing and may have important clinical and practical implications. Measures of executive control are reflective of daily functioning (including instrumental and basic activities of daily living; Vaughan and Giovanello, 2010; Martyr and Clare, 2012) and executive dysfunction has been reported in early AD, where hippocampal volume is particularly relevant (Albert, 1996). Therefore, paying attention to markers of cognitive reserve in determining underlying neurodegeneration in relation to the actual clinical diagnosis of dementia may be particularly important, as those with higher reserve may be more likely to be diagnosed later in their progression through the typical AD-related neuropathological spectrum. However, given the cross-sectional nature of this study, we cannot rule out that the patterns of results could be explained by developmental or other pre-existing differences.

Supplemental analyses separating participants without dementia into SCD and aMCI groups revealed similar results to the analyses in which the two groups were combined, although the moderating effects of cognitive reserve on the brain volume-cognition associations appeared to be more apparent in participants with SCD compared to aMCI. This pattern may suggest that cognitive reserve begins to lose some of the protective effects on cognitive performance as individuals progress through stages of cognitive impairment. Additionally, results for SCD were found for both the hippocampal volume analyses and total gray matter volume analyses whereas for aMCI they were found for total gray matter volume analyses only. Since the hippocampus is affected early along the AD continuum, the lack of effects for aMCI may indicate impairment that has started in the hippocampus but has yet to influence other brain areas.

For participants with dementia, the relationship between greater total gray matter volume and better visuospatial skills was magnified in those with less education, providing evidence for the compensatory aspect of cognitive reserve. There are several plausible explanations for this result. First, individuals with high reserve who may have experienced significant atrophy (leading to less objective brain volume) can compensate for this loss and still perform well cognitively. Second, individuals

with high reserve who have objectively greater brain volume, but poorer cognitive performance compared to individuals with low reserve, may have already experienced relatively extensive atrophy compared to their pre-dementia volume. Therefore, even though they appear to have greater absolute volume than the sample average, this presumed volume loss may have contributed to their poor performance on cognitive tests relative to participants with low cognitive reserve. These assumptions should be tested with longitudinal data.

Given that visuospatial skills was the only domain that evidenced a significant moderation, it is possible that the neuropathology experienced in dementia may have been too extensive for participants with high reserve to compensate performance in the other cognitive domains. Still, higher education has also been found to strengthen the effect of total gray matter atrophy on cognitive decline (Mungas et al., 2018), so this pattern may reflect the rapid decline participants with high reserve experience after dementia onset. Sensitivity analyses limited to participants with an AD dementia diagnosis (pure or mixed) did not reveal any significant moderating effects of cognitive reserve on the brain volume-cognition relationship. This may be the result of an underpowered analysis, since the magnitude of effects were similar for the interactions found in main analyses, but these effects did not meet the significance criterion.

The supplemental analyses restricting the sample to participants with data on main lifetime occupation revealed relatively consistent results, except that a significant interaction between hippocampal volume and language appeared. This pattern may suggest that language ability is particularly affected by prolonged exposure to a particular work environment.

We also conducted analyses in participants without and with dementia stratified by sex. Overall, regardless of what domain or proxy was of focus, in men and women without dementia, higher cognitive reserve strengthened the brain volume-cognition relationship. There was one overlapping effect between men and women without dementia (i.e., interaction between total gray matter volume and education on language performance). In men, education moderated the total gray matter volume associations with memory and visuospatial skills, and occupational position moderated the total gray matter volume-attention/working memory relationship. In women, education moderated the association between hippocampal volume and executive control, and occupational position moderated the associations between total gray matter volume and executive control, language, and memory. The magnitude of the interaction effects was slightly stronger in women. In participants with dementia, there were no significant effects found for men, but inverse relationships found between brain volume and cognition for women with high education. Future work should assess sex in relation to cognitive reserve to determine whether these effects replicate.

Our results contribute to the growing field assessing relationships between cognitive reserve, brain health, and cognitive/clinical outcomes by suggesting that both the protective and compensatory components of cognitive reserve seem to be present at different points in clinical impairment. For individuals with higher reserve, there seems to be an inflection point such that before the onset of clinically ascertained dementia, higher reserve is associated with better brain health; cognitive reserve becomes compensatory once neuropathology begins to accumulate allowing individuals to maintain cognitive performance and avoid clinical impairment; and finally individuals with high reserve exhibit accelerated cognitive decline due to the expansive accumulation of neuropathology over time. Our results provide additional evidence for the notion that the transition from cognitive reserve being protective to compensatory may occur at the clinical onset of dementia (Stern et al., 2020). Although our study does not include measures of neuropathology, neurodegeneration is thought to be a downstream process that results from the accumulation of beta-amyloid and tau in the brain, followed by loss of volume. The role of cognitive reserve as protective vs. compensatory against neuropathology may reflect the same underlying process which should be assessed more thoroughly in future work.

A non-linear relationship between brain health and cognitive outcomes among individuals with high reserve may help explain our results and help disentangle the discrepant findings of past research investigating the moderating effect of cognitive reserve on the brain health-cognition relationship. Staekenborg et al. (2020) recently hypothesized this U-shaped relationship between cognitive reserve and neuropathology which also aligns with the model of compensation Gregory et al. (2017) present to understand relationships between cognitive performance and brain volume in neurodegenerative disease. A U-shaped relationship between cognitive reserve, brain volume, and neuropathology supports both (a) the stronger positive relationship between brain volume and cognition for individuals with high reserve prior to the probable appearance of extensive neuropathology and clinical impairment and (b) the attenuated relationship between brain volume and cognitive outcomes for individuals with high reserve after extensive neuropathology has likely accumulated and the compensatory mechanism of reserve is no longer available. Conversely, regarding (a), given the cross-sectional nature of this study, the positive relationship between brain volume and cognition found in participants without dementia could be due to developmental or other pre-existing differences between groups. Regarding (b), we also found evidence of an inverse relationship between brain volume and cognition for participants with high reserve in the dementia group. This may reflect two complementary phenomena: first, individuals with high reserve who have experienced neurodegeneration may still be able to compensate their performance despite the relatively extensive neurodegeneration. This pattern is reflected in Figure 2 where participants with less brain volume than the sample average, but high cognitive reserve, perform better than participants at the same level of brain volume but who have low cognitive reserve. Second, individuals with greater brain volume relative to the sample average and high cognitive reserve may reflect individuals who have experienced extensive neurodegeneration but still have objectively greater brain volume than the sample, impeding on their ability to perform cognitively at the expected level. Finally, our study includes brain volume rather than neuropathology. Since brain atrophy would be farther down the cascade than neuropathological changes including the spread of beta-amyloid and tau in the brain, it is possible that a different pattern results in this downstream measure compared to more immediate neuropathology effects.

Another explanation of divergent findings could revolve around the inclusion of different types of AD neuropathology or brain integrity in studies. Specifically, what is chosen as the marker of AD neuropathology or brain integrity may impact how cognitive reserve influences the pathology- cognition relationship depending on the level of cognitive impairment of the sample. According to the amyloid-cascade hypothesis (Hardy and Higgins, 1992; Karran et al., 2011; Jack and Holtzman, 2013; Jack et al., 2013), the temporal ordering of AD pathophysiology begins with amyloid-beta, followed by tau, and leading to eventual neurodegeneration. Cognitive reserve’s attenuating effect on neuropathology may be better detected by markers of amyloid-beta accumulation in healthy older adults who exhibit no clinical symptoms of dementia or individuals early in the disease progression before significant cognitive decline occurs (Menardi et al., 2018). Subsequently, later pathophysiological markers of AD (i.e., volumetric measures reflecting neurodegeneration) may have a detectable attenuating effect of cognitive reserve on the brain health-cognition relationship once more advanced clinical impairment has occurred. Prior to the appearance of the compensatory mechanism of reserve, associations between brain health and cognitive outcomes may be stronger for individuals with higher levels of reserve compared to lower levels of reserve, representing the neural reserve component of cognitive reserve (Stern, 2009).

Other reasons for the discrepant findings among studies in this area may reflect differences among samples. Sociocultural differences between samples may reflect inconsistent associations between neuropathology and cognition depending on contextual aspects of cognitive reserve proxies. For example, the qualitative aspects of education present in the United States compared to European nations in the 1900s, differences in mandatory or standard educational requirements, and differences in years of education across samples may all contribute to these mixed findings. Similarly, differences in occupational characteristics across culturally distinct geographic regions or occupational opportunities available in certain historical timepoints may also result in disparate findings. Additionally, differences in risk for cognitive decline and dementia are known to exist, yet little is known about how cognitive reserve may relate to these demographic differences. For example, some research suggests that cognitive reserve may operate differently in men and women due to biological or sociocultural differences between the sexes (Rocca, 2017; Ewers, 2020; Subramaniapillai et al., 2021). Investigating these potentially interacting causes of mixed findings is important for future work to better understand what influences individuals’ risk for future impairment.

Strengths, limitations, and future directions

Strengths of the current study include (a) examination of the cognitive reserve hypothesis among different diagnostic groups to assess how cognitive reserve may differentially moderate the association between brain volume and cognition, (b) the use of an extensive neuropsychological battery that allowed for investigation of several cognitive domains, and (c) the inclusion of two commonly used proxies of cognitive reserve. One main weakness is the cross-sectional design which prevented (a) investigation of longitudinal change in cognition or brain volume, (b) causal/directional interpretation of the results, and (c) the disentanglement of the role of cognitive reserve as protective and/or compensatory. Other weaknesses include: low reliability in one of the cognitive domains (i.e., executive control) as indicated by Cronbach’s alpha values, absence of the use of biomarkers in diagnosis, and the use of a sample from one memory clinic in the Czech Republic which could limit generalizability of results. Future research should include participants who exhibit transitions to dementia from normal cognition to assess how moderating effects of cognitive reserve proxies on brain integrity-cognition relationships may weaken as clinical progression, and the associated neurodegeneration, occurs. For example, testing moderating effects of cognitive reserve at different clinical thresholds (i.e., assessing these relationships in the same participants who transition from SCD to aMCI to dementia) would more clearly reveal the extent to which cognitive reserve operates as protective and/or compensatory and how effects differ in each diagnosis. Additionally, further examination of how development versus brain atrophy may influence associations is warranted. Future work should also consider how inclusion of different AD biomarkers and markers of neuropathology may affect how cognitive reserve moderates associations between brain structure and cognitive outcomes. Finally, since our study presents exploratory findings regarding the moderating effect of cognitive reserve in participants with dementia of different etiologies, future research should isolate AD dementia more specifically to verify the robustness of findings.

Implications

By recognizing that cognitive reserve moderates the brain volume-cognition relationship, clinical decisions should incorporate markers of cognitive reserve, which in turn may help clinicians identify the link between the level of brain health and actual cognitive performance. If individuals are known to have low markers for reserve (e.g., low education or occupational position), other proxies of reserve could be offered to these individuals (e.g., increased cognitive or physical leisure activity) to promote brain health. At a population-level, more support could be provided for educational attainment and occupational advancement to promote healthy cognitive aging throughout society.

Conclusion

We provided evidence for cognitive reserve as a moderator of the relationship between brain volume and cognition. This study contributes to the growing evidence that lifecourse cognitive reserve proxies such as educational attainment and occupational position may play an important role in understanding the association between neural resources, represented by brain volume, and cognition in older adults. The findings also provide unique and new information about the distinct influences of cognitive reserve proxies on the specific associations between brain volume and cognition in participants without and with dementia syndrome.
