### Intermediate filaments (IFs) 
中间丝（英语：Intermediate filaments，IF，又译中间纤维）直径10纳米(nm)左右，介于7 nm的肌动蛋白微丝和25 nm的微管之间。与后两者不同的是中间丝是最稳定的细胞骨架成分，它主要起支撑作用。中间丝在细胞中围绕着细胞核分布，成束成网，并扩展到细胞质膜，与质膜相连结。中间丝没有极性。它们是一个相关的蛋白质家族, 分享共同的结构和序列特征。大多数类型的中间丝存在于细胞质，但有一种类型的中间丝–核纤层蛋白存在于细胞核。 I类和II类: 酸性和碱性角蛋白 角蛋白是中间丝中的一类，分子量约40～70KDa，出现在表皮细胞中，在人类上皮细胞中有20多种不同的角蛋白，分为α和β两类。角蛋白赋予细胞体一定的刚性。癌细胞需要对角蛋白进行重新分布，以使自身变得柔韧，可以通过基底膜或血管壁上的细小孔洞。 
	The many isoforms are divided in two groups: epithelial keratins (about 20) in epithelial cells (image to right) trichocytic keratins (about 13) (hair keratins), which make up hair, nails, horns and reptilian scales. Regardless of the group, keratins are either acidic or basic. **Acidic and basic keratins bind each other to form acidic-basic heterodimers and these heterodimers then associate to make a keratin filament**. Cytokeratin filaments laterally associate with each other to create a thick bundle of ~50nm radius. The optimal radius of such bundles is determined by the interplay between the long range electrostatic repulsion and short range hydrophobic attraction. Subsequently, these bundles would intersect through junctions to form a dynamic network, spanning the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. 
III类: 波形蛋白，所有中间丝分布最广的蛋白质，可在成纤维细胞、白细胞和血管内皮细胞中被发现。它们支持细胞膜，保持一些细胞器在细胞质内固定的地方，并向细胞核发送膜受体信号。 
IV类: 神经丝 - 沿脊椎动物神经元轴突高浓度发现的中间丝的IV型家族。 V类: 核纤层蛋白-核纤层蛋白核纤层蛋白是在细胞核中具有结构功能的纤维蛋白。 
VI类: 未分类 
#### Nuclear lamins 
核纤层蛋白（英語：Nuclear lamins）也被称为第五类中间纤维（Class V intermediate filaments），是细胞核中提供结构功能和调控转录的纤维蛋白。核纤层蛋白与膜相关蛋白相互交织，形成了核膜内侧下方的核纤层。核纤层蛋白涉及有丝分裂中核膜的解体与重建，以及核孔的定位。 这类蛋白定位于核区室中的两个区域，一个是核纖層—核膜内侧的蛋白质内衬层，另一个为核质中核骨架撑起的核基质。 通过与其它中间纤维细胞骨架的比较可以发现核纤层蛋白在盘卷1b（coil 1b）中多了42个残基（六个七肽重复）。其C-端结构域还包括一个核定位信号（NLS）,一个免疫球蛋白折叠样结构域（Ig-fold-like domain），在许多例子中C-端还包括一个CaaX盒且被异戊二烯化和羧甲基化（核纤层蛋白C不具有CAAX盒）。核纤层蛋白A会进一步加工移除最后15个氨基酸包括其中的异戊二烯化半胱氨酸。 核纤层蛋白A和核纤层蛋白C可以头尾相对组成同源二聚体。 在有丝分裂中，核纤层蛋白被成熟促进因子（MPF）磷酸化，从而使其解聚，核膜解体。在染色体分离后，核纤层蛋白去磷酸化，重建核膜。 
#### Cytokeratins 
are keratin proteins found in the intracytoplasmic cytoskeleton of epithelial tissue. They are an important component of intermediate filaments, which help cells resist mechanical stress.[1] Expression of these cytokeratins within epithelial cells is largely specific to particular organs or tissues. Thus they are used clinically to identify the cell of origin of various human tumors. 细胞角蛋白是存在于上皮组织细胞质内细胞骨架中的角蛋白。它们是中间细丝的重要组成部分，有助于细胞抵抗机械应力。[1]这些细胞角蛋白在上皮细胞中的表达在很大程度上是特定器官或组织的特异性的。因此，它们被临床用于识别各种人类肿瘤的起源细胞。 
##### K17 
Keratin 17 is a type I cytokeratin. It is found in nail beds, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and other epidermal appendages. Mutations in the gene encoding this protein lead to PC-K17 (previously known as Jackson-Lawler) type pachyonychia congenita and steatocystoma multiplex 角蛋白 17 是一种 I 型细胞角蛋白。 它存在于甲床、毛囊、皮脂腺和其他表皮附件中。 编码该蛋白质的基因突变导致 PC-K17（以前称为 Jackson-Lawler）型先天性厚甲症和多发性脂肪囊肿 HMWCK high-molecular weight cytokeratin 
### Adehesion 
#### Cadherins 
Cadherins (named for "calcium-dependent adhesion") are a type of cell adhesion molecule (CAM) that are important in the formation of adherens junctions to bind cells with each other. Cadherins are a class of type-1 transmembrane proteins, and they are dependent on calcium (Ca2+) ions to function, hence their name. **Cell-cell adhesion is mediated by extracellular cadherin domains**, whereas the intracellular cytoplasmic tail associates with numerous adaptors and signaling proteins, collectively referred as the cadherin adhesome. 钙粘蛋白（以“钙依赖性粘附”命名）是一种细胞粘附分子 (CAM)，在形成粘附连接以将细胞彼此结合时很重要。 钙粘蛋白是一类 1 型跨膜蛋白，它们依赖钙 (Ca2+) 离子起作用，因此得名。 细胞间粘附是由细胞外钙粘蛋白结构域介导的，而细胞内细胞质尾部与许多接头和信号蛋白相关联，统称为钙粘蛋白粘附体。

#### E-cadherin 
Cadherin-1 (not to be confused with the APC/C activator protein CDH1) also known as CAM 120/80 or epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) or uvomorulin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CDH1 gene.[5] Mutations are correlated with gastric, breast, colorectal, thyroid, and ovarian cancers. CDH1 has also been designated as CD324 (cluster of differentiation 324). It is a tumor suppressor gene. Cadherin-1（不要与 APC/C 激活蛋白 CDH1 混淆）也称为 CAM 120/80 或上皮钙粘蛋白（E-cadherin）或 uvomorulin，是一种在人类中由 CDH1 基因编码的蛋白质。 突变与胃癌、乳腺癌、结直肠癌、甲状腺癌和卵巢癌有关。 CDH1 也被指定为 CD324（分化簇 324）。 **它是一种肿瘤抑制基因**。 

Cadherin-1 is a classical member of the cadherin superfamily. The encoded protein is a calcium-dependent cell–cell adhesion glycoprotein composed of five extracellular cadherin repeats, a transmembrane region, and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail. Mutations in this gene are correlated with gastric, breast, colorectal, thyroid, and ovarian cancers. Loss of function is thought to contribute to progression in cancer by increasing proliferation, invasion, and/or metastasis. The ectodomain of this protein mediates bacterial adhesion to mammalian cells, and the cytoplasmic domain is required for internalization. Identified transcript variants arise from mutation at consensus splice sites.[8] 

E-cadherin (epithelial) is the most well-studied member of the cadherin family. It consists of 5 cadherin repeats (EC1 ~ EC5) in the extracellular domain, one transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain that binds p120-catenin and beta-catenin. The intracellular domain contains a highly-phosphorylated region vital to beta-catenin binding and, therefore, to E-cadherin function.[citation needed] Beta-catenin can also bind to alpha-catenin. Alpha-catenin participates in regulation of actin-containing cytoskeletal filaments. In epithelial cells, E-cadherin-containing cell-to-cell junctions are often adjacent to actin-containing filaments of the cytoskeleton. 

E-cadherin is first expressed in the 2-cell stage of mammalian development, and becomes phosphorylated by the 8-cell stage, where it causes compaction.[citation needed] In adult tissues, E-cadherin is expressed in epithelial tissues, where it is constantly regenerated with a 5-hour half-life on the cell surface.[citation needed] Cell–cell interactions mediated by E-cadherin are crucial to blastula formation in many animals. Cadherin-1 是钙粘蛋白超家族的经典成员。编码的蛋白质是钙依赖性细胞-细胞粘附糖蛋白，由五个细胞外钙粘蛋白重复序列、一个跨膜区和一个高度保守的细胞质尾部组成。该基因的突变与胃癌、乳腺癌、结直肠癌、甲状腺癌和卵巢癌有关。功能丧失被认为通过增加增殖、侵袭和/或转移促进癌症进展。这种蛋白质的胞外域介导细菌对哺乳动物细胞的粘附，细胞质域是内化所必需的。已鉴定的转录变异来自于共有剪接位点的突变 E-钙粘蛋白（上皮）是钙粘蛋白家族中研究最充分的成员。它由胞外域中的 5 个钙粘蛋白重复序列(EC1 ~ EC5)、一个跨膜域和一个结合 p120-catenin 和 β-catenin 的胞内域组成。细胞内结构域包含一个对 β-连环蛋白结合至关重要的高度磷酸化区域，因此对 E-钙粘蛋白功能至关重要。 β-连环蛋白也可以与 α-连环蛋白结合。 α-连环蛋白参与调节含肌动蛋白的细胞骨架细丝。在上皮细胞中，含有 E-钙粘蛋白的细胞间连接通常与细胞骨架的含有肌动蛋白的细丝相邻。 E-钙粘蛋白首先在哺乳动物发育的 2 细胞阶段表达，并在 8 细胞阶段磷酸化，导致压实。 在成人组织中，E-钙粘蛋白在上皮组织中表达，在那里它在细胞表面以 5 小时的半衰期不断再生。 E-钙粘蛋白介导的细胞-细胞相互作用对于许多动物的囊胚形成至关重要。 
##### CDH1 
Cdh1 is one of the substrate adaptor protein of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Functioning as an activator of the APC/C, **Cdh1 regulates the activity and substrate specificity of this ubiquitin E3-ligase**. The human homolog is encoded by the FZR1 gene, which is not to be confused with the CDH1 gene. Cdh1 是出芽酵母酿酒酵母中后期促进复合物 (APC) 的底物衔接蛋白之一。 作为 APC/C 的激活剂，**Cdh1 调节这种 泛素 E3 连接酶的活性 和底物特异性**。 人类同源物由 FZR1 基因编码，不要与 CDH1 基因混淆。 ##### Anaphase-promoting complex (also called the cyclosome or APC/C) (a type of E3 ubiquitin ligase) Anaphase-promoting complex (also called the cyclosome or APC/C) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that marks target cell cycle proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome. The APC/C is a large complex of 11–13 subunit proteins, including a cullin (Apc2) and RING (Apc11) subunit much like SCF. Other parts of the APC/C have unknown functions but are highly conserved. It was the discovery of the APC/C (and SCF) and their key role in eukaryotic cell-cycle regulation that established the importance of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in cell biology. Once perceived as a system exclusively involved in removing damaged protein from the cell, ubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation by the proteasome is now perceived as a universal regulatory mechanism for signal transduction whose importance approaches that of protein phosphorylation 后期促进复合物（也称为环体或 APC/C）是一种 E3 泛素连接酶，可标记目标细胞周期蛋白以供 26S 蛋白酶体降解。 APC/C 是一个由 11-13 个亚基蛋白组成的大型复合体，包括一个 cullin (Apc2) 和 RING (Apc11) 亚基，很像 SCF。 APC/C 的其他部分功能未知，但高度保守。 正是 APC/C（和 SCF）的发现及其在真核细胞周期调节中的关键作用确立了泛素介导的蛋白水解在细胞生物学中的重要性。 曾经被认为是专门参与从细胞中去除受损蛋白质的系统，泛素化和随后的蛋白酶体蛋白质降解现在被认为是信号转导的通用调节机制，其重要性接近蛋白质磷酸化 
###### ubiquitin ligase (E3 ubiquitin ligase) 
A ubiquitin ligase (also called an E3 ubiquitin ligase) is a protein that recruits an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that has been loaded with ubiquitin, recognizes a protein substrate, and assists or directly catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the protein substrate. The ubiquitin is attached to a lysine on the target protein by an isopeptide bond.[2] E3 ligases interact with both the target protein and the E2 enzyme, and so impart substrate specificity to the E2. Commonly, E3s polyubiquitinate their substrate with Lys48-linked chains of ubiquitin, targeting the substrate for destruction by the proteasome. However, many other types of linkages are possible and alter a protein's activity, interactions, or localization. Ubiquitination by E3 ligases regulates diverse areas such as cell trafficking, DNA repair, and signaling and is of profound importance in cell biology. E3 ligases are also key players in cell cycle control, mediating the degradation of cyclins, as well as cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor proteins.[3] The human genome encodes over 600 putative E3 ligases, allowing for tremendous diversity in substrates 泛素连接酶（也称为 E3 泛素连接酶）是一种蛋白质，它招募已装载泛素的 E2 泛素结合酶，识别蛋白质底物，并协助或直接催化泛素从 E2 转移到蛋白质底物.泛素通过异肽键与目标蛋白上的赖氨酸相连。 [2] E3 连接酶与靶蛋白和 E2 酶相互作用，因此赋予 E2 底物特异性。通常，E3s 将其底物与 Lys48 连接的泛素链多泛素化，靶向底物以被蛋白酶体破坏。然而，许多其他类型的连接也是可能的，它们会改变蛋白质的活性、相互作用或定位。 E3 连接酶的泛素化调节细胞运输、DNA 修复和信号传导等多个领域，在细胞生物学中具有重要意义。 E3 连接酶也是细胞周期控制的关键参与者，介导细胞周期蛋白以及细胞周期蛋白依赖性激酶抑制剂蛋白的降解。 [3]人类基因组编码超过 600 种推定的 E3 连接酶，使底物具有巨大的多样性 
#### APC (tumor suppressor gene) 
Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) also known as deleted in polyposis 2.5 (DP2.5) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the APC gene.[4] The APC protein is a negative regulator that controls beta-catenin concentrations and interacts with E-cadherin, which are involved in cell adhesion. Mutations in the APC gene may result in colorectal cancer. 腺瘤性息肉病大肠杆菌 (APC) 也称为息肉病 2.5 (DP2.5) 缺失，是一种在人类中由 APC 基因编码的蛋白质。 APC 蛋白是一种负调节因子，可控制 β-连环蛋白浓度并与 参与细胞粘附的 E-钙粘蛋白相互作用。 APC 基因的突变可能导致结直肠癌。 APC被归类为肿瘤抑制基因。肿瘤抑制基因阻止可能导致癌性肿瘤的细胞不受控制的生长。 APC 基因产生的蛋白质在决定细胞是否可能发展成肿瘤的几个细胞过程中起着关键作用。 APC 蛋白有助于控制细胞分裂的频率、它如何附着在组织内的其他细胞上、细胞如何极化和 3D 结构的形态发生，或者细胞是在组织内部移动还是远离组织移动。这种蛋白质还有助于确保通过细胞分裂产生的细胞中的染色体数量是正确的。 APC 蛋白主要通过与其他蛋白结合来完成这些任务，尤其是那些参与细胞附着和信号传导的蛋白。一种蛋白质的活性，特别是 β-连环蛋白，由 APC 蛋白控制（参见：Wnt 信号通路）。 β-连环蛋白的调节可防止刺激细胞分裂的基因过于频繁地开启，并防止细胞过度生长。 人类 APC 基因位于带 q22.2 (5q22.2) 的 5 号染色体长 (q) 臂上。 APC 基因已被证明包含一个内部核糖体进入位点。 APC 直向同源物 也已在所有可获得完整基因组数据的哺乳动物中得到鉴定。 APC is classified as a tumor suppressor gene. Tumor suppressor genes prevent the uncontrolled growth of cells that may result in cancerous tumors. The protein made by the APC gene plays a critical role in several cellular processes that determine whether a cell may develop into a tumor. The APC protein helps control how often a cell divides, how it attaches to other cells within a tissue, how the cell polarizes and the morphogenesis of the 3D structures,[6] or whether a cell moves within or away from a tissue. This protein also helps ensure that the chromosome number in cells produced through cell division is correct. The APC protein accomplishes these tasks mainly through association with other proteins, especially those that are involved in cell attachment and signaling. The activity of one protein in particular, beta-catenin, is controlled by the APC protein (see: Wnt signaling pathway). Regulation of beta-catenin prevents genes that stimulate cell division from being turned on too often and prevents cell overgrowth. The human APC gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 in band q22.2 (5q22.2). The APC gene has been shown to contain an internal ribosome entry site. APC orthologs[7] have also been identified in all mammals for which complete genome data are available. 
#### N-cadherin 
N-cadherin, also known as Cadherin-2 (CDH2) or neural cadherin (NCAD) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CDH2 gene.[5][6] CDH2 has also been designated as CD325 (cluster of differentiation 325). N-cadherin is a transmembrane protein expressed in multiple tissues and functions to mediate cell–cell adhesion. In cardiac muscle, N-cadherin is an integral component in adherens junctions residing at intercalated discs, which function to mechanically and electrically couple adjacent cardiomyocytes. Alterations in expression and integrity of N-cadherin protein has been observed in various forms of disease, including human dilated cardiomyopathy. Variants in CDH2 have also been identified to cause a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder. N-钙粘蛋白，也称为钙粘蛋白-2 (CDH2) 或神经钙粘蛋白 (NCAD)，是一种在人类中由 CDH2 基因编码的蛋白质。 CDH2 也被指定为 CD325（分化簇 325）。 N-钙粘蛋白是一种跨膜蛋白，在多种组织中表达，具有**介导细胞间粘附的功能**。 在心肌中，N-钙粘蛋白是位于嵌入椎间盘的粘附连接的一个组成部分，其功能是机械和电耦合相邻的心肌细胞。 在各种形式的疾病中都观察到了 N-钙粘蛋白的表达和完整性的改变，包括人类扩张型心肌病。 CDH2 的变体也已被确定会导致综合征性神经发育障碍。 N-Cadherin is commonly found in cancer cells and provides a mechanism for transendothelial migration. When a cancer cell adheres to the endothelial cells of a blood vessel it up-regulates the src kinase pathway, which phosphorylates beta-catenins attached to both N-cadherin (this protein) and E-cadherins. This causes the intercellular connection between two adjacent endothelial cells to fail and allows the cancer cell to slip through N-钙粘蛋白通常存在于癌细胞中，并为跨内皮迁移提供了一种机制。 当癌细胞粘附在血管的内皮细胞上时，它会上调 src 激酶途径，该途径使连接到 N-钙粘蛋白（这种蛋白质）和 E-钙粘蛋白的 β-连环蛋白磷酸化。 这会导致两个相邻内皮细胞之间的细胞间连接失败，并允许癌细胞通过 
#### 纤网蛋白 
是高分子量（~440kDa）的糖蛋白细胞外基质，和细胞膜内称为整合素的受体蛋白结合。和整合素类似，纤连蛋白也会和许多细胞外基质的成分结合，像胶原蛋白、纤维蛋白、硫酸类肝素蛋白聚糖（也就是多配体聚糖）。 纤连蛋白可促进细胞粘连、增殖，还可以修复受损细胞，刺激细胞分泌各种功能蛋白。纤连蛋白能够调节细胞与细胞间质之间的动态平衡，改善细胞内外微循环，保证内外物质运输。纤连蛋白与淋巴细胞表面接合，刺激淋巴细胞产生免疫抗体，改善机体的免疫系统，阻碍机体衰老。在机体细胞自然凋亡过程中，纤连蛋白利用其能够 迁移细胞的生物学效应，调节凋亡细胞与新生细胞的平衡关系。 纤连蛋白在伤口愈合过程中起到至关重要的作用。当伤口出现后，FN会出现在伤口血浆中，起到止血、保护损伤组织的作用。在伤口修复过程中，FN调动吞噬细胞吞噬异物，促进成纤维细胞分泌蛋白酶，分解蛋白杂质。在损伤组织生长过程中，FN提高整合素的表达，从而加快组织修复。 纤连蛋白是胚胎发育过程中必不可少的物质，可以指导胚胎发育过程中的细胞黏附和迁移。在哺乳动物的发育中，FN的缺失会造成中胚层、神经管和血管的缺陷。在两栖动物的发育中，FN的缺失也会导致中胚层生长的缺陷。 正常人的唾液中含有纤连蛋白，它们可以清除口腔与咽喉中的致病细菌，防止出现口腔与咽喉病变。 
### motility 
#### Annexin 2 
is involved in diverse cellular processes such as cell motility (especially that of the epithelial cells), linkage of membrane-associated protein complexes to the actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis, fibrinolysis, ion channel formation, and cell matrix interactions. It is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein whose function is to help organize exocytosis of intracellular proteins to the extracellular domain. Annexin II is a pleiotropic protein meaning that its function is dependent on place and time in the body. 膜联蛋白 2 参与多种细胞过程，例如细胞运动（尤其是上皮细胞的运动）、膜相关蛋白复合物与肌动蛋白细胞骨架的连接、内吞作用、纤维蛋白溶解、离子通道形成和细胞基质相互作用。 它是一种钙依赖性磷脂结合蛋白，其功能是帮助组织胞内蛋白质胞外结构域的胞吐作用。 膜联蛋白 II 是一种多效性蛋白质，这意味着其功能取决于在体内的位置和时间。 
### Cell cycle 
#### Stratifin/14-3-3σ (cell cycle checkpoint protein) 
also known as 14-3-3 protein sigma or 14-3-3σ protein) is a protein encoded by the SFN gene in humans. The protein is named for its presence in stratified epithelial cells. This gene **encodes a cell cycle checkpoint protein**. The encoded protein binds to translation and initiation factors and functions as a regulator of mitotic translation. In response to DNA damage this protein plays a role in preventing DNA errors during mitosis. 也称为 14-3-3 蛋白 sigma 或 14-3-3σ 蛋白）是一种由人类 SFN 基因编码的蛋白质。 该蛋白质因其在分层上皮细胞中的存在而得名。 该基因**编码细胞周期检查点蛋白**。 编码的蛋白质与翻译和起始因子结合，并作为有丝分裂翻译的调节剂发挥作用。 为了应对 DNA 损伤，这种蛋白质在有丝分裂期间防止 DNA 错误中发挥作用。 
#### p16/CDKN2A 
p16 (also known as p16INK4a, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, CDKN2A, multiple tumor suppressor 1 and numerous other synonyms), is a protein that slows cell division by slowing the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 phase to the S phase, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor. It is encoded by the CDKN2A gene. A deletion (the omission of a part of the DNA sequence during replication) in this gene can result in insufficient or non-functional p16, accelerating the cell cycle and resulting in many types of cancer. p16 can be used as a biomarker to improve the histological diagnostic accuracy of grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). p16 is also implicated in the prevention of melanoma, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, vulvar cancer and esophageal cancer. p16 was discovered in 1993. It is a protein with 148 amino acids and a molecular weight of 16 kDa that comprises four ankyrin repeats. The name of p16 is derived from its molecular weight, and the alternative name p16INK4a refers to its role in inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4 
#### p27/CDKN1B 
Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27Kip1) is an enzyme inhibitor that in humans is encoded by the CDKN1B gene. It encodes a protein which belongs to the Cip/Kip family of cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor proteins. The encoded protein binds to and **prevents the activation of cyclin E-CDK2 or cyclin D-CDK4 complexes**, and thus controls the cell cycle progression at G1. It is often referred to as a cell cycle inhibitor protein because its major function is to stop or slow down the cell division cycle. 
#### Cyclin D 
Cyclins are eukaryotic proteins that form holoenzymes with cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdk), which they activate. The abundance of cyclins is generally regulated by protein synthesis and degradation through APC/C- and CRL-dependent pathways. Cyclin D is one of the major cyclins produced in terms of its functional importance. It interacts with four Cdks: Cdk2, 4, 5, and 6. In proliferating cells, cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex accumulation is of great importance for cell cycle progression. Namely, cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex partially phosphorylates retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb), whose inhibition can induce expression of some genes (for example: cyclin E) important for S phase progression. 细胞周期蛋白是真核蛋白，可与细胞周期蛋白依赖性蛋白激酶 (Cdk) 形成全酶，并激活它们。 细胞周期蛋白的丰度通常由蛋白质合成和降解通过 APC/C 和 CRL 依赖性途径调节。 就其功能重要性而言，细胞周期蛋白 D 是产生的主要细胞周期蛋白之一。 它与四种 Cdk 相互作用：Cdk2、4、5 和 6。在增殖细胞中，细胞周期蛋白 D-Cdk4/6 复合物的积累对于细胞周期进程非常重要。 即，细胞周期蛋白 D-Cdk4/6 复合物部分磷酸化成视网膜细胞瘤肿瘤抑制蛋白 (Rb)，其抑制作用可诱导某些对 S 期进展很重要的基因（例如：细胞周期蛋白 E）的表达。 
#### Cyclin E 
is a member of the cyclin family. Cyclin E binds to G1 phase Cdk2, which is required for the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle that determines initiation of DNA duplication. The Cyclin E/CDK2 complex phosphorylates p27Kip1 (an inhibitor of Cyclin D), tagging it for degradation, thus promoting expression of Cyclin A, allowing progression to S phase. cyclin E 和 cdk2 结合的 复合物，是分裂所必需的， 其能 降解 抑癌分子 p27 
#### CDK4(Cyclin-dependent kinase 4) 
Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 also known as cell division protein kinase 4 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the CDK4 gene. CDK4 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family. 
#### Rb 
The retinoblastoma protein (protein name abbreviated pRb; gene name abbreviated Rb, RB or RB1) is a tumor suppressor protein that is dysfunctional in several major cancers. One function of pRb is to prevent excessive cell growth by inhibiting cell cycle progression until a cell is ready to divide. When the cell is ready to divide, pRb is phosphorylated, inactivating it, and the cell cycle is allowed to progress. It is also a recruiter of several chromatin remodeling enzymes such as methylases and acetylases. pRb belongs to the pocket protein family, whose members have a pocket for the functional binding of other proteins. Should an oncogenic protein, such as those produced by cells infected by high-risk types of human papillomavirus, bind and inactivate pRb, this can lead to cancer. The RB gene may have been responsible for the evolution of multicellularity in several lineages of life including animals. Rb restricts the cell's ability to replicate DNA by preventing its progression from the G1 (first gap phase) to S (synthesis phase) phase of the cell division cycle. **Rb binds and inhibits E2 promoter-binding–protein-dimerization partner (E2F-DP) dimers**, which are transcription factors of the E2F family that push the cell into S phase.By keeping E2F-DP inactivated, RB1 maintains the cell in the G1 phase, preventing progression through the cell cycle and acting as a growth suppressor. The Rb-E2F/DP complex also attracts a histone deacetylase (HDAC) protein to the chromatin, reducing transcription of S phase promoting factors, further suppressing DNA synthesis. 
#### E2F 
E2F is a group of genes that encodes a family of transcription factors (TF) in higher eukaryotes. Three of them are activators: E2F1, 2 and E2F3a. Six others act as suppressors: E2F3b, E2F4-8. All of them are involved in the cell cycle regulation and synthesis of DNA in mammalian cells. E2Fs as TFs bind to the TTTCCCGC (or slight variations of this sequence) consensus binding site in the target promoter sequence. 
### transcription factor 
#### GLI1 
The Gli proteins are the **effectors of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and have been shown to be involved in cell fate determination, proliferation** and patterning in many cell types and most organs during embryo development. In the developing spinal cord the **target genes of Gli proteins, that are themselves transcription factors**, are arranged into a complex gene regulatory network that translates the extracellular concentration gradient of Sonic hedgehog into different cell fates along the dorsoventral axis.[7] The Gli transcription factors activate/inhibit transcription by binding to Gli responsive genes and by interacting with the transcription complex. The Gli transcription factors have DNA binding zinc finger domains which bind to consensus sequences on their target genes to initiate or suppress transcription. Yoon showed that mutating the Gli zinc finger domain inhibited the proteins effect proving its role as a transcription factor. Gli proteins have an 18-amino acid region highly similar to the α-helical herpes simplex viral protein 16 activation domain. This domain contains a consensus recognition element for the human TFIID TATA box-binding protein associated factor TAFII31. Other proteins such as Missing in Metastasis (MIM/BEG4) have been shown to potentiate the effects of the Gli transcription factors on target gene transcription. Gli and MIM have been shown to act synergistically to induce epidermal growth and MIM + Gli1 overexpressing grafts show similar growth patterns to Shh grafts. Gli 蛋白是 Hedgehog (Hh) 信号传导的效应物，已被证明参与胚胎发育过程中许多细胞类型和大多数器官的细胞命运决定、增殖和模式化。 [6]在发育中的脊髓中，Gli 蛋白的靶基因，它们本身就是转录因子，被排列成一个复杂的基因调控网络，将 Sonic 刺猬的细胞外浓度梯度转化为沿背腹轴的不同细胞命运。 Gli 转录因子通过与 Gli 响应基因结合并通过与转录复合物相互作用来激活/抑制转录。 Gli 转录因子具有 DNA 结合锌指结构域，可与其靶基因上的共有序列结合以启动或抑制转录。[8] Yoon [9] 表明，突变 Gli 锌指结构域会抑制蛋白质效应，证明其作为转录因子的作用。 Gli 蛋白具有与 α-螺旋单纯疱疹病毒蛋白 16 激活域高度相似的 18 个氨基酸区域。该结构域包含人类 TFIID TATA 盒结合蛋白相关因子 TAFII31 的共有识别元件。 [9]其他蛋白质如转移中缺失 (MIM/BEG4) 已被证明可以增强 Gli 转录因子对靶基因转录的影响。 Gli 和 MIM 已显示出协同作用以诱导表皮生长，并且 MIM + Gli1 过表达的移植物显示出与 Shh 移植物相似的生长模式。 ### immunoglobulin superfamily 
#### PECAM-1/cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) 
PECAM-1 is found on the surface of platelets, monocytes, neutrophils, and some types of T-cells, and makes up a large portion of endothelial cell intercellular junctions. The encoded protein is **a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is likely involved in leukocyte transmigration, angiogenesis, and integrin activation.** CD31 on endothelial cells binds to the CD38 receptor on natural killer cells for those cells to attach to the endothelium. 
### Other 
#### Ewing sarcoma 
is a type of cancer that may be a bone sarcoma or a soft-tissue sarcoma. Symptoms may include swelling and pain at the site of the tumor, fever, and a bone fracture. The most common areas where it begins are the legs, pelvis 骨盆, and chest wall. In about 25% of cases, the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis. Complications may include a pleural胸膜的 effusion渗出 or paraplegia截瘫. 
#### PARP Inhibitor 
A substance that blocks an enzyme in cells called PARP. PARP helps repair DNA when it becomes damaged. DNA damage may be caused by many things, including exposure to UV light, radiation, certain anticancer drugs, or other substances in the environment. In cancer treatment, blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Also called poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor. #### BRCA BRCA1 and BRCA2 are unrelated proteins, but both are normally expressed in the cells of breast and other tissue, where they **help repair damaged DNA, or destroy cells if DNA cannot be repaired**. 
#### caspase 3 
执行死亡的效应蛋白，分裂形式是 激活状态 Caspase-3 is activated in the apoptotic cell both by extrinsic (death ligand) and intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways. The zymogen feature of caspase-3 is necessary because if unregulated, caspase activity would kill cells indiscriminately. As an executioner caspase, the caspase-3 zymogen has virtually no activity until it is cleaved by an initiator caspase after apoptotic signaling events have occurred. One such signaling event is the introduction of granzyme B, which can activate initiator caspases, into cells targeted for apoptosis by killer T cells. This extrinsic activation then triggers the hallmark caspase cascade characteristic of the apoptotic pathway, in which caspase-3 plays a dominant role. In intrinsic activation, cytochrome c from the mitochondria works in combination with caspase-9, apoptosis-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), and ATP to process procaspase-3.These molecules are sufficient to activate caspase-3 in vitro, but other regulatory proteins are necessary in vivo. Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) extract has been shown to inhibit the activation of caspase 3 in B-amyloid treated human neuronal cells. 作为执行者 caspase，caspase-3 酶原在凋亡信号事件发生后被起始 **caspase 切割之前几乎没有活性**。 
#### Ki67 
Ki-67（MKI67）
是一种由人MKI67基因编码的蛋白质。该蛋白与细胞的增殖密切相关，在有丝分裂期以及分裂间期的细胞（G1、S、G2、M期）中都能检出Ki-67蛋白，有丝分裂停止的细胞（G0期）中则无Ki-67蛋白质存在。另外，研究发现使Ki-67失活可以抑制rRNA的合成，提示Ki-67蛋白与rRNA（核糖体RNA）的转录密切相关 
#### MUC16 
This gene encodes a protein that is a member of the mucin family. Mucins are high molecular weight, O-glycosylated proteins that play an important role in forming a protective mucous barrier, and are found on the apical surfaces of the epithelia. The encoded protein is a membrane-tethered mucin that contains an extracellular domain at its amino terminus, a large tandem repeat domain, and a transmembrane domain with a short cytoplasmic domain. The amino terminus is highly glycosylated, while the repeat region contains 156 amino acid repeats unit that are rich in serines, threonines, and prolines. Interspersed within the repeats are Sea urchin sperm protein Enterokinase and Agrin (SEA) modules, leucine-rich repeats and ankyrin (ANK) repeats. These regions together form the ectodomain, and there is a potential cleavage site found near an SEA module close to the transmembrane domain. This protein is thought to play a role in forming a barrier, protecting epithelial cells from pathogens. Products of this gene have been used as a marker for different cancers, with higher expression levels associated with poorer outcomes. 该基因编码一种属于粘蛋白家族成员的蛋白质。**粘蛋白是高分子量的 O-糖基化蛋白质，在形成保护性粘液屏障方面发挥重要作用**，存在于上皮细胞的顶端表面。编码的蛋白质是一种膜系粘蛋白，在其氨基末端包含一个细胞外结构域、一个大串联重复结构域和一个具有短胞质结构域的跨膜结构域。氨基末端高度糖基化，而重复区域包含 156 个富含丝氨酸、苏氨酸和脯氨酸的氨基酸重复单元。散布在重复序列中的是海胆精子蛋白肠激酶和集聚蛋白 (SEA) 模块、富含亮氨酸的重复序列和锚蛋白 (ANK) 重复序列。这些区域一起形成胞外域，并且在靠近跨膜域的 SEA 模块附近发现了一个潜在的切割位点。这种蛋白质被认为在形成屏障、保护上皮细胞免受病原体侵害方面发挥作用。该基因的产物已被用作不同癌症的标记物，较高的表达水平与较差的结果相关。 
#### ANXA2 
This gene encodes a member of the annexin family. Members of this **calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein** family play a role in the regulation of **cellular growth and in signal transduction pathways**. This protein functions as an autocrine factor which heightens osteoclast formation and bone resorption. This gene has three pseudogenes located on chromosomes 4, 9 and 10, respectively. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Annexin A2 expression has been found to **correlate with resistance to treatment against various cancer forms**. 
#### HNRNP K 
Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (also protein K) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the HNRNPK gene. It is found in the cell nucleus that binds to pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) as a component of heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles. The simian homolog is known as protein H16. Both **proteins bind to single-stranded DNA as well as to RNA and can stimulate the activity of RNA polymerase II,** the protein responsible for most gene transcription. The relative affinities of the proteins for DNA and RNA vary with solution conditions and are inversely correlated, so that conditions promoting strong DNA binding result in weak RNA binding. RNA binding protein domains in other proteins that are similar to the RNA binding domain of protein K are called K-homology or KH domains. Protein K has been the subject of study related to colorectal cancer, in which an RNA editing event inducing the expression of an isoform containing a point mutation was found to be specific to cancerous cells. 异质核核糖核蛋白 K（也称为蛋白 K）是一种在人类中由 HNRNPK 基因编码的蛋白质。它存在于细胞核中，作为异质核糖核蛋白颗粒的组成部分与前信使 RNA (mRNA) 结合。猿猴同系物被称为蛋白质 H16。 **这两种蛋白质都与单链 DNA 和 RNA 结合，并能刺激 RNA 聚合酶 II 的活性**，这是负责大多数基因转录的蛋白质。蛋白质对 DNA 和 RNA 的相对亲和力随溶液条件而变化，呈负相关，因此促进强 DNA 结合的条件导致弱 RNA 结合。 与蛋白 K 的 RNA 结合域相似的其他蛋白质中的 RNA 结合蛋白域称为 K-同源性或 KH 域。 蛋白质 K 一直是与结直肠癌相关的研究主题，其中发现诱导含有点突变的同种型表达的 RNA 编辑事件对癌细胞具有特异性。 
#### TNF 
Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha), is an **inflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages/monocytes** during acute inflammation and is responsible for a diverse range of signalling events within cells, leading to necrosis or apoptosis. The protein is also important for resistance to infection and cancers. 
#### Aire 
自身免疫调节因子（Autoimmune regulator）是人体内由AIRE基因表现的蛋白质[5]。AIRE是在胸腺髓质表现的转录因子，使人体不会被自身的免疫系统攻击。 每个T细胞都会辨识由抗原呈递细胞上MHC分子复合体呈现的特定抗原，这一识别需要T细胞表面的T细胞受体。T细胞受体由VDJ重组片段所制造，所以T细胞多样性很高，而每个T细胞都有专一性。接着，会辨识自身蛋白质的T细胞受器必须在还在胸腺内时消除。透过AIRE作用，胸腺髓质上皮细胞（mTEC）会表现身体其他各个地方的主要蛋白质（所谓的 TRA），而且将会和这些蛋白质反应的T细胞透过细胞程序性死亡（细胞凋亡）的方式消除。因此AIRE针对自体辨识的T细胞进行负向筛选[6]。当AIRE受损时，会辨识人体自身抗原的T细胞会离开胸腺，进入血液循环，并可能导致许多的自身免疫疾病。

### Protein kinase A 
protein kinase is a kinase which selectively modifies other proteins by covalently adding phosphates to them (phosphorylation) as opposed to kinases which modify lipids, carbohydrates, or other molecules. Phosphorylation usually results in a functional change of the target protein (substrate) by changing enzyme activity, cellular location, or association with other proteins. The human genome contains about 500 protein kinase genes and they constitute about 2% of all human genes. There are two main types of protein kinase, the great majority are serine/threonine kinases, which phosphorylate the hydroxyl groups of serines and threonines in their targets and the other are tyrosine kinases, although additional types exist. Protein kinases are also found in bacteria and plants. Up to 30% of all human proteins may be modified by kinase activity, and kinases are known to regulate the majority of cellular pathways, especially those involved in signal transduction. 与修饰脂质、碳水化合物或其他分子的激酶相反，蛋白激酶是通过向其他蛋白质共价添加磷酸盐（磷酸化）来选择性修饰其他蛋白质的激酶。 磷酸化通常通过改变酶活性、细胞位置或与其他蛋白质的结合导致目标蛋白质（底物）的功能改变。 人类基因组包含大约 500 个蛋白激酶基因，它们约占所有人类基因的 2%。 **有两种主要类型的蛋白激酶，大多数是丝氨酸/苏氨酸激酶，它们磷酸化其靶标中丝氨酸和苏氨酸的羟基，另一种是酪氨酸激酶**，尽管存在其他类型。 在细菌和植物中也发现了蛋白激酶。 多达 30% 的人类蛋白质可能会被激酶活性修饰，并且已知激酶可以调节大多数细胞通路，尤其是参与信号转导的通路。 
#### Serine/threonine-specific protein kinases 
Serine/threonine protein kinases (EC 2.7.11.1) phosphorylate the OH group of serine or threonine (which have similar side-chains). Activity of these protein kinases can be regulated by specific events (e.g., DNA damage), as well as numerous chemical signals, including cAMP/cGMP, diacylglycerol, and Ca2+/calmodulin. One very important group of protein kinases are the MAP kinases (acronym from: "mitogen-activated protein kinases"). Important subgroups are the kinases of the ERK subfamily, typically activated by mitogenic signals, and the stress-activated protein kinases JNK and p38. While MAP kinases are serine/threonine-specific, they are activated by combined phosphorylation on serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. Activity of MAP kinases is restricted by a number of protein phosphatases, which remove the phosphate groups that are added to specific serine or threonine residues of the kinase and are required to maintain the kinase in an active conformation. Two major factors influence activity of MAP kinases: a) signals that activate transmembrane receptors (either natural ligands or crosslinking agents) and proteins associated with them (mutations that simulate active state) b) signals that inactivate the phosphatases that restrict a given MAP kinase. Such signals include oxidant stress. 丝氨酸/苏氨酸蛋白激酶 (EC 2.7.11.1) 磷酸化丝氨酸或苏氨酸（具有相似的侧链）的 OH 基团。这些蛋白激酶的活性可受特定事件（例如 DNA 损伤）以及众多化学信号（包括 cAMP/cGMP、二酰基甘油和 Ca2+/钙调蛋白）的调节。一组非常重要的蛋白激酶是 MAP 激酶（缩写来自：“丝裂原活化蛋白激酶”）。重要的亚群是 ERK 亚家族的激酶，通常由有丝分裂信号激活，以及应激激活的蛋白激酶 JNK 和 p38。虽然 MAP 激酶是丝氨酸/苏氨酸特异性的，但它们通过丝氨酸/苏氨酸和酪氨酸残基的联合磷酸化而被激活。 MAP 激酶的活性受到许多蛋白磷酸酶的限制，这些磷酸酶会去除添加到激酶特定丝氨酸或苏氨酸残基上的磷酸基团，这些磷酸基团是维持激酶处于活性构象所必需的。有两个主要因素影响 MAP 激酶的活性：a) 激活跨膜受体的信号（天然配体或交联剂）和与之相关的蛋白质（模拟活性状态的突变） b) 使限制给定 MAP 激酶的磷酸酶失活的信号。此类信号包括氧化应激。 Types include those acting directly as receptors (Receptor protein serine/threonine kinase) and Intracellular signaling peptides and proteins. 
##### MAPK 
A mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK or MAP kinase) is a type of protein kinase that is specific to the amino acids serine and threonine (i.e., a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase). MAPKs are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis. MAP kinases are found in eukaryotes only, but they are fairly diverse and encountered in all animals, fungi and plants, and even in an array of unicellular eukaryotes. 丝裂原活化蛋白激酶（MAPK 或 MAP 激酶）是一种对氨基酸丝氨酸和苏氨酸（即丝氨酸/苏氨酸特异性蛋白激酶）具有特异性的蛋白激酶。 MAPK 参与指导细胞对各种刺激的反应，例如有丝分裂原、渗透压、热休克和促炎细胞因子。 它们调节细胞功能，包括增殖、基因表达、分化、有丝分裂、细胞存活和细胞凋亡。 MAP 激酶仅存在于真核生物中，但它们相当多样化，并且在所有动物、真菌和植物中都会遇到，甚至在一系列单细胞真核生物中也会遇到。

##### Mos/Raf kinases 
form part of the MAPKK Kinase family and are activated by growth factors. The enzyme functions to stimulate growth of cells. Raf inhibition has become the target for new anti-metastatic cancer drugs as they inhibit the MAPK cascade and reduce cell proliferation. 
##### AKT kinase = Protein Kinase B 
The v-akt gene was identified as the oncogene of retrovirus AKT8. The gene codes for a protein kinase. Human homologs of the AKT8 oncogenic protein were identified in 1987.By 1995 it had been found that Akt kinases function as mitogen-activated kinases downstream from cell surface receptors that activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Three human akt genes exist. All three Akt kinases regulate cell proliferation and Akt2 is particularly important for insulin actions in cells. A major target of Akt kinases is glycogen synthase kinase-3. v-akt基因被鉴定为逆转录病毒AKT8的癌基因。 该基因编码蛋白激酶。 AKT8 致癌蛋白的人类同源物于 1987 年被鉴定。到 1995 年，已发现 Akt 激酶在激活磷酸肌醇 3-激酶的细胞表面受体下游起到丝裂原激活激酶的作用。 存在三个人类 akt 基因。 所有三种 Akt 激酶都调节细胞增殖，Akt2 对细胞中的胰岛素作用尤为重要。 Akt 激酶的主要目标是糖原合酶激酶 3。 plays a key role in multiple cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, apoptosis, cell proliferation, transcription, and cell migration. AKT1 is involved in cellular survival pathways, by inhibiting apoptotic processes. Akt1 is also able to induce protein synthesis pathways, and is therefore a key signaling protein in the cellular pathways that lead to skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and general tissue growth. Mouse model with complete deletion of Akt1 manifests growth retardation and increased spontaneous apoptosis in tissues such as testes and thymus. Since it can block apoptosis, and thereby promote cell survival, Akt1 has been implicated as a major factor in many types of cancer. Akt (now also called Akt1) was originally identified as the oncogene in the transforming retrovirus, AKT8. Akt1 通过抑制细胞凋亡过程参与细胞存活途径。 Akt1 还能够诱导蛋白质合成途径，因此是导致骨骼肌肥大和一般组织生长的细胞途径中的关键信号蛋白。 Akt1 完全缺失的小鼠模型表现出生长迟缓和睾丸和胸腺等组织的自发凋亡增加。 由于它可以阻止细胞凋亡，从而促进细胞存活，因此 Akt1 被认为是许多类型癌症的主要因素。 Akt（现在也称为 Akt1）最初被确定为转化逆转录病毒 AKT8 中的致癌基因。 Akt2 is an important signaling molecule in the insulin signaling pathway. It is required to induce glucose transport. In a mouse which is null for Akt1 but normal for Akt2, glucose homeostasis is unperturbed, but the animals are smaller, consistent with a role for Akt1 in growth. In contrast, mice which do not have Akt2, but have normal Akt1, have mild growth deficiency and display a diabetic phenotype (insulin resistance), again consistent with the idea that Akt2 is more specific for the insulin receptor signaling pathway. Akt2 是胰岛素信号通路中的重要信号分子。需要诱导葡萄糖转运。在 Akt1 无效但 Akt2 正常的小鼠中，葡萄糖稳态未受干扰，但动物较小，这与 Akt1 在生长中的作用一致。相比之下，没有 Akt2 但有正常 Akt1 的小鼠有轻度生长缺陷并表现出糖尿病表型（胰岛素抵抗），这再次与 Akt2 对胰岛素受体信号通路更具特异性的观点一致。 Akt isoforms are overexpressed in a variety of human tumors, and, at the genomic level, are amplified in gastric adenocarcinomas (Akt1), ovarian (Akt2), pancreatic (Akt2) and breast (Akt2) cancer. Akt 亚型在多种人类肿瘤中过度表达，并且在基因组水平上，在胃腺癌 (Akt1)、卵巢癌 (Akt2)、胰腺癌 (Akt2) 和乳腺癌 (Akt2) 中扩增。 The role of Akt3 is less clear, though it appears to be predominantly expressed in the brain. It has been reported that mice lacking Akt3 have small brains. Akt3 的作用不太清楚，尽管它似乎主要在大脑中表达。据报道，缺乏 Akt3 的小鼠大脑较小。 
	Name 
		The name Akt does not refer to its function. The "Ak" in Akt refers to the AKR mouse strain that develops spontaneous thymic lymphomas. The "t" stands for 'thymoma'; the letter was added when a transforming retrovirus was isolated from the Ak strain, which was termed "Akt-8". When the oncogene encoded in this virus was discovered, it was termed v-Akt. Thus, the later identified human analogues were named accordingly. Akt 这个名字并不是指它的功能。 Akt 中的“Ak”是指发生自发性胸腺淋巴瘤的 AKR 小鼠品系。 “t”代表“胸腺瘤”； 这封信是在从 Akt-8 菌株中分离出转化逆转录病毒时添加的。 当发现这种病毒中编码的致癌基因时，它被称为 v-Akt。 因此，后来确定的人类类似物被相应地命名。 
##### Protein kinase C ('PKC') 
is actually a family of protein kinases consisting of ~10 isozymes. They are divided into three subfamilies: conventional (or classical), novel, and atypical based on their second messenger requirements. 
##### Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases or CaM kinases (CAMK) 
are primarily regulated by the Ca2+/calmodulin complex. 
##### CK2, also known by the misnomer casein kinase 2 
#### Tyrosine-specific protein kinases 
Tyrosine specific protein kinases (EC 2.7.10.1 and EC 2.7.10.2) phosphorylate tyrosine amino acid residues, and like serine/threonine-specific kinases are used in signal transduction. Tyrosine kinases encompases the **receptor tyrosine kinase proteins** which contain a transmembrane domain, as well as the **non-receptor tyrosine kinases** which do not possess transmembrane domains. **They act primarily as growth factor receptors** and in downstream signaling from growth factors 
##### Receptor tyrosine 酪氨酸 kinases
[Receptor tyrosine kinases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_tyrosine_kinase) consist of a transmembrane receptor with a tyrosine kinase domain protruding into the cytoplasm. They play an important role in regulating cell division, cellular differentiation, and morphogenesis. More than 50 receptor tyrosine kinases are known in mammals. The extracellular domain serves as the ligand-binding part of the molecule. It can be a separate unit that is attached to the rest of the receptor by a disulfide bond. The same mechanism can be used to bind two receptors together to form a homo- or heterodimer. The transmembrane element is a single α helix. The intracellular or cytoplasmic domain is responsible for the (highly conserved) kinase activity, as well as several regulatory functions. 细胞外结构域充当分子的配体结合部分。 它可以是一个单独的单元，通过二硫键连接到受体的其余部分。 可以使用相同的机制将两个受体结合在一起形成同二聚体或异二聚体。 跨膜元件是单个α螺旋。 细胞内或细胞质结构域负责（高度保守的）激酶活性，以及几种调节功能。 Most RTKs are single subunit receptors but some exist as multimeric complexes, e.g., the insulin receptor that forms disulfide linked dimers in the presence of hormone (insulin); moreover, ligand binding to the extracellular domain induces formation of receptor dimers. Each monomer has a single hydrophobic transmembrane-spanning domain composed of 25 to 38 amino acids, an extracellular N terminal region, and an intracellular C terminal region. The extracellular N terminal region exhibits a variety of conserved elements including immunoglobulin (Ig)-like or epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, fibronectin type III repeats, or cysteine-rich regions that are characteristic for each subfamily of RTKs; these domains contain primarily a ligand-binding site, which binds extracellular ligands, e.g., a particular growth factor or hormone.[2] The intracellular C terminal region displays the highest level of conservation and comprises catalytic domains responsible for the kinase activity of these receptors, which catalyses receptor autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of RTK substrates. 大多数 RTK 是单亚基受体，但有些作为多聚体复合物存在，例如，在激素（胰岛素）存在下形成二硫键连接的二聚体的胰岛素受体；此外，配体与胞外域的结合诱导受体二聚体的形成。 每个单体都有一个由 25 到 38 个氨基酸组成的单一疏水跨膜结构域、一个细胞外 N 端区域和一个细胞内 C 端区域。 细胞外 N 端区域表现出多种保守元件，包括免疫球蛋白 (Ig) 样或表皮生长因子 (EGF) 样结构域、纤连蛋白 III 型重复序列或富含半胱氨酸的区域，这些区域是每个 RTK 亚家族的特征；这些结构域主要包含一个配体结合位点，可结合细胞外配体，例如特定的生长因子或激素。 细胞内 C 末端区域显示出最高水平的保守性，包含负责这些受体激酶活性的催化域，催化受体自磷酸化和 RTK 底物的酪氨酸磷酸化。 
###### ERBB 
The [ErbB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ErbB) family of proteins contains four receptor tyrosine kinases, structurally related to the **epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)**, its first discovered member. In humans, the family includes Her1 (**EGFR, ErbB1**), **Her2 (Neu, ErbB2)**, Her3 (ErbB3), and Her4 (ErbB4). The gene symbol, ErbB, is derived from the name of a viral oncogene to which these receptors are homologous: **erythroblastic 成红细胞的 leukemia viral oncogene**. The ErbB protein family or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family is a family of four structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases. Insufficient ErbB signaling in humans is associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's Disease. In mice, loss of signaling by any member of the ErbB family results in embryonic lethality with defects in organs including the lungs, skin, heart, and brain. Excessive ErbB signaling is associated with the development of a wide variety of types of solid tumor. ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 are found in many human cancers and their excessive signaling may be critical factors in the development and malignancy of these tumors. 
###### Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 
The fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) are, as their name implies, receptors that bind to members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of proteins. Some of these receptors are involved in pathological conditions. Fibroblast growth factors comprise the largest family of growth factor ligands at 23 members. The natural alternate splicing of four fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes results in the production of over 48 different isoforms of FGFR. These isoforms vary in their ligand binding properties and kinase domains; however, all share a common extracellular region composed of three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (D1-D3), and thus belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Interactions with FGFs occur via FGFR domains D2 and D3. Each receptor can be activated by several FGFs. In many cases, the FGFs themselves can also activate more than one receptor. This is not the case with FGF-7, however, which can activate only FGFR2b. A gene for a fifth FGFR protein, FGFR5, has also been identified. In contrast to FGFRs 1-4, it lacks a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain, and one isoform, FGFR5γ, only contains the extracellular domains D1 and D2. 
###### Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the main inducers of endothelial cell proliferation and permeability of blood vessels. Two RTKs bind to VEGF at the cell surface, VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1). The VEGF receptors have an extracellular portion consisting of seven Ig-like domains so, like FGFRs, belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They also possess a single transmembrane spanning region and an intracellular portion containing a split tyrosine-kinase domain. VEGF-A binds to VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1). VEGFR-2 appears to mediate almost all of the known cellular responses to VEGF. The function of VEGFR-1 is less well defined, although it is thought to modulate VEGFR-2 signaling. Another function of VEGFR-1 may be to act as a dummy/decoy receptor, sequestering VEGF from VEGFR-2 binding (this appears to be particularly important during vasculogenesis in the embryo). A third receptor has been discovered (VEGFR-3); however, VEGF-A is not a ligand for this receptor. VEGFR-3 mediates lymphangiogenesis in response to VEGF-C and VEGF-D. ### Non-receptor tyrosine kinase (Receptor-associated tyrosine kinases) Tyrosine kinases recruited to a receptor following hormone binding are receptor-associated tyrosine kinases and are involved in a number of signaling cascades, in particular those involved in cytokine signaling (but also others, including growth hormone). One such receptor-associated tyrosine kinase is Janus kinase (JAK), many of whose effects are mediated by STAT proteins. 激素结合后被募集到受体的酪氨酸激酶是受体相关的酪氨酸激酶，并且参与许多信号级联反应，特别是那些参与细胞因子信号传导的级联反应（还有其他的，包括生长激素）。 一种这样的受体相关酪氨酸激酶是 Janus 激酶 (JAK)，其许多作用是由 STAT 蛋白介导的。 ![](https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/19/8/1933/F1.large.jpg) 
### GTPase 
GTPases are a large family of hydrolase enzymes that bind to the nucleotide guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and hydrolyze it to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The GTP binding and hydrolysis takes place in the highly conserved G domain common to many GTPases. **由 Heterotrimeric G proteins, Small GTPases, Translation factor family, Translocation factors, Large GTPases 组成** Multiple translation factor family GTPases play important roles in initiation, elongation and termination of protein biosynthesis. For a discussion of Translocation factors and the role of GTP, see signal recognition particle (SRP). See dynamin as a prototype for large monomeric GTPases. 
#### G proteins 
G proteins, also known as guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, are a family of proteins that act as molecular switches inside cells, and are involved in transmitting signals from a variety of stimuli outside a cell to its interior. Their activity is regulated by factors that control their ability to bind to and hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). When they are bound to GTP, they are 'on', and, when they are bound to GDP, they are 'off'. G proteins belong to the larger group of enzymes called GTPases. **There are two classes of G proteins**. The first function as monomeric **small GTPases** (small G-proteins), while the second function as heterotrimeric **G protein complexes**. The latter class of complexes is made up of alpha (α), beta (β) and gamma (γ) subunits. In addition, the beta and gamma subunits can form a stable dimeric complex referred to as the beta-gamma complex. Heterotrimeric G proteins located within the cell are activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that span the cell membrane. Signaling molecules bind to a domain of the GPCR located outside the cell, and an intracellular GPCR domain then in turn activates a particular G protein. Some active-state GPCRs have also been shown to be "pre-coupled" with G proteins. The G protein activates a cascade of further signaling events that finally results in a change in cell function. G protein-coupled receptor and G proteins working together transmit signals from many hormones, neurotransmitters, and other signaling factors. G proteins regulate metabolic enzymes, ion channels, transporter proteins, and other parts of the cell machinery, controlling transcription, motility, contractility, and secretion, which in turn regulate diverse systemic functions such as embryonic development, learning and memory, and homeostasis. G 蛋白，也称为鸟嘌呤核苷酸结合蛋白，是一个蛋白质家族，在细胞内充当分子开关，并参与将信号从细胞外的各种刺激传递到细胞内部。它们的活性受控制其结合三磷酸鸟苷 (GTP) 并将其水解为二磷酸鸟苷 (GDP) 的能力的因素调节。当它们与 GTP 绑定时，它们是“开启”的，而当它们与 GDP 绑定时，它们是“关闭”的。 G 蛋白属于更大的一组酶，称为 GTP 酶。有两类G蛋白。第一个作为单体小 GTP 酶（小 G 蛋白）起作用，而第二个作为异源三聚体 G 蛋白复合物起作用。后一类复合物由 alpha (α)、beta (β) 和 gamma (γ) 亚基组成。 此外，β 和 γ 亚基可以形成稳定的二聚体复合物，称为 β-γ 复合物。 位于细胞内的异源三聚体 G 蛋白被跨越细胞膜的 G 蛋白偶联受体 (GPCR) 激活。 信号分子与位于细胞外的 GPCR 结构域结合，然后细胞内的 GPCR 结构域又会激活特定的 G 蛋白。一些活性状态的 GPCR 也被证明与 G 蛋白“预耦合”。 G 蛋白激活一系列进一步的信号事件，最终导致细胞功能的变化。 G 蛋白偶联受体和 G 蛋白共同作用从许多激素、神经递质和其他信号因子传递信号。 G 蛋白调节代谢酶、离子通道、转运蛋白和细胞机制的其他部分，控制转录、运动、收缩和分泌，进而调节多种系统功能，如胚胎发育、学习和记忆以及体内平衡。

##### Ras superfamily = small GTPases 
The Ras superfamily is a protein superfamily of **small GTPases**. Members of the superfamily are divided into families and subfamilies based on their structure, sequence and function. The **five main families** are Ras, Rho, Ran, Rab and Arf GTPases. The **Ras family itself is further divided into 6 subfamilies**: Ras, Ral, Rap, Rheb, Rad and Rit. Miro is a recent contributor to the superfamily. Each subfamily shares the common core G domain, which provides essential GTPase and nucleotide exchange activity. The surrounding sequence helps determine the functional specificity of the small GTPase, for example the 'Insert Loop', common to the Rho subfamily, specifically contributes to binding to effector proteins such as WASP. **In general, the Ras family is responsible for cell proliferation: Rho for cell morphology, Ran for nuclear transport, and Rab and Arf for vesicle transport.** Ras-superfamily small GTPases and their G-protein cousins act by a conserved mechanism: the molecules' signaling activities differ when bound to GTP versus GDP, and their GTPase activity (which hydrolyzes GTP to GDP), determines their GTP-bound versus GDP-bound state. Generally, GTP-bound molecules are thought to be active signaling molecules and GDP-bound forms are thought to be inactive (Bourne et al., 1991). Molecules that regulate Ras GTPases include GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which promote the GDP-bound state of Ras GTPases by activating their GTPase activity and thus favor the inactive state, and GTP exchange factors (GEFs) which promote the active, GTP-bound state by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP. Ras 超家族小 GTP 酶和它们的 G 蛋白表亲通过一个保守的机制起作用：当与 GTP 结合与 GDP 结合时，分子的信号活性不同，并且它们的 GTPase 活性（将 GTP 水解为 GDP）决定了它们的 GTP- 约束与 GDP 约束状态。 通常，GTP 结合分子被认为是有活性的信号分子，而 GDP 结合形式被认为是无活性的（Bourne 等，1991）。 调节 Ras GTPases 的分子包括 GTPase 激活蛋白 (GAPs)，它通过激活它们的 GTPase 活性来促进 Ras GTPases 的 GDP 结合状态，从而有利于非活性状态，以及 GTP 交换因子 (GEFs)，它促进活性的 GTP 结合 促进 GDP 与 GTP 的交换。 Small GTPases function as monomers and have a molecular weight of about 21 kilodaltons that consists primarily of the GTPase domain.[15] They are also called small or monomeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins, small or monomeric GTP-binding proteins, or small or monomeric G-proteins, and because they have significant homology with the first-identified such protein, named Ras, they are also referred to as Ras superfamily GTPases. Small GTPases generally serve as molecular switches and signal transducers for a wide variety of cellular signaling events, often involving membranes, vesicles or cytoskeleton.[16][15] According to their primary amino acid sequences and biochemical properties, the many Ras superfamily small GTPases are further divided into five subfamilies with distinct functions: Ras, Rho ("Ras-homology"), Rab, Arf and Ran.[15] While many small GTPases are activated by their GEFs in response to intracellular signals emanating from cell surface receptors (particularly growth factor receptors), regulatory GEFs for many other small GTPases are activated in response to intrinsic cell signals, not cell surface (external) signals. 小 GTPase 作为单体发挥作用，分子量约为 21 千道尔顿，主要由 GTPase 结构域组成。 [15]它们也被称为小分子或单体鸟嘌呤核苷酸结合调节蛋白、小分子或单体 GTP 结合蛋白、或小分子或单体 G 蛋白，并且由于它们与第一个被鉴定的此类蛋白质 Ras 具有显着的同源性，因此它们也被称为被称为 Ras 超家族 GTP 酶。小 GTP 酶通常用作各种细胞信号事件的分子开关和信号转换器，通常涉及膜、囊泡或细胞骨架。 [16] [15]根据它们的主要氨基酸序列和生化特性，许多 Ras 超家族小 GTPase 进一步分为五个具有不同功能的亚家族：Ras、Rho（“Ras 同源性”）、Rab、Arf 和 Ran。 [15]虽然许多小 GTP 酶响应于细胞表面受体（特别是生长因子受体）发出的细胞内信号而被其 GEF 激活，但许多其他小 GTP 酶的调节性 GEF 响应于细胞内在信号而非细胞表面（外部）信号而被激活。

#### Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin 雷帕霉素 (mTOR) 
The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), previously referred to as the mammalian target of rapamycin, and sometimes called FK506-binding protein 12-rapamycin-associated protein 1 (FRAP1), is a kinase that in humans is encoded by the MTOR gene. mTOR is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase family of protein kinases. mTOR links with other proteins and serves as a core component of two distinct protein complexes, mTOR complex 1 and mTOR complex 2, which regulate different cellular processes. In particular, as a core component of both complexes, mTOR functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility, cell survival, protein synthesis, autophagy, and transcription. As a core component of mTORC2, mTOR also functions as a tyrosine protein kinase that promotes the activation of insulin receptors and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors. mTORC2 has also been implicated in the control and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton. 雷帕霉素的机制靶标 (mTOR)以前称为哺乳动物雷帕霉素靶标，有时也称为 FK506 结合蛋白 12-雷帕霉素相关蛋白 1 (FRAP1)，是一种在人类中由MTOR 基因。mTOR 是蛋白激酶的磷脂酰肌醇 3-激酶相关激酶家族的成员。 mTOR 与其他蛋白质相连，并作为两种不同蛋白质复合物的核心成分，mTOR 复合物 1 和 mTOR 复合物 2，它们调节不同的细胞过程。 特别是，作为这两种复合物的核心成分，mTOR 作为丝氨酸/苏氨酸蛋白激酶发挥作用，调节细胞生长、细胞增殖、细胞运动、细胞存活、蛋白质合成、自噬和转录。 作为 mTORC2 的核心成分，mTOR 还具有酪氨酸蛋白激酶的功能，可促进胰岛素受体和胰岛素样生长因子 1 受体的激活。 mTORC2 还与肌动蛋白细胞骨架的控制和维持有关。 
##### Function 
mTOR integrates the input from upstream pathways, including insulin, growth factors (such as IGF-1 and IGF-2), and amino acids. mTOR also senses cellular nutrient, oxygen, and energy levels. The mTOR pathway is a central regulator of mammalian metabolism and physiology, with important roles in the function of tissues including liver, muscle, white and brown adipose tissue, and the brain, and is dysregulated in human diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, depression, and certain cancers. Rapamycin inhibits mTOR by associating with its intracellular receptor FKBP12. The FKBP12–rapamycin complex binds directly to the FKBP12-Rapamycin Binding (FRB) domain of mTOR, inhibiting its activity. mTOR 整合了上游通路的输入，包括胰岛素、生长因子（如 IGF-1 和 IGF-2）和氨基酸。 mTOR 还感知细胞营养、氧气和能量水平。 mTOR 通路是哺乳动物代谢和生理学的中心调节器，在包括肝脏、肌肉、白色和棕色脂肪组织 和大脑在内的组织功能中发挥重要作用，并且在人类疾病（如糖尿病）中失调， 肥胖、抑郁和某些癌症。 雷帕霉素通过与其细胞内受体 FKBP12 结合来抑制 mTOR。FKBP12-雷帕霉素复合物直接与 mTOR 的 FKBP12-雷帕霉素结合 (FRB) 结构域结合，抑制其活性。 
##### Complex 
mTOR is the catalytic subunit of two structurally distinct complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. Both complexes localize to different subcellular compartments, thus affecting their activation and function. Upon activation by Rheb, mTORC1 localizes to the Ragulator-Rag complex on the lysosome surface where it then becomes active in the presence of sufficient amino acids. 
###### mTORC1 
mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) is composed of mTOR, regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor), mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (mLST8) and the non-core components PRAS40 and DEPTOR. This complex functions as a nutrient/energy/redox sensor and controls protein synthesis. The activity of mTORC1 is regulated by rapamycin, insulin, growth factors, phosphatidic acid, certain amino acids and their derivatives (e.g., l-leucine and β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid), mechanical stimuli, and oxidative stress. mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) 由 mTOR、mTOR 的调节相关蛋白 (Raptor)、哺乳动物致死蛋白 SEC13 蛋白 8 (mLST8) 以及非核心成分 PRAS40 和 DEPTOR 组成。 这种复合物用作营养/能量/氧化还原传感器并控制蛋白质合成。 mTORC1 的活性受雷帕霉素、胰岛素、生长因子、磷脂酸、某些氨基酸及其衍生物（例如，l-亮氨酸和β-羟基β-甲基丁酸）、机械刺激和氧化应激的调节。 
###### mTORC2 
mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) is composed of MTOR, rapamycin-insensitive companion of MTOR (RICTOR), MLST8, and mammalian stress-activated protein kinase interacting protein 1 (mSIN1). mTORC2 has been shown to function as an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton through its stimulation of F-actin stress fibers, paxillin, RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, and protein kinase C α (PKCα). mTORC2 also phosphorylates the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB on serine residue Ser473, thus affecting metabolism and survival. Phosphorylation of Akt's serine residue Ser473 by mTORC2 stimulates Akt phosphorylation on threonine residue Thr308 by PDK1 and leads to full Akt activation. In addition, mTORC2 exhibits tyrosine protein kinase activity and phosphorylates the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor (InsR) on the tyrosine residues Tyr1131/1136 and Tyr1146/1151, respectively, leading to full activation of IGF-IR and InsR. mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) 由 MTOR、雷帕霉素不敏感的 MTOR 伴侣 (RICTOR)、MLST8 和哺乳动物应激激活蛋白激酶相互作用蛋白 1 (mSIN1) 组成。 mTORC2 已被证明通过其刺激 F-肌动蛋白应力纤维、桩蛋白、RhoA、Rac1、Cdc42 和蛋白激酶 C α (PKCα) 作为肌动蛋白细胞骨架的重要调节剂发挥作用。 mTORC2 还磷酸化丝氨酸残基 Ser473 上的丝氨酸/苏氨酸蛋白激酶 Akt/PKB，从而影响代谢和存活。mTORC2 对 Akt 丝氨酸残基 Ser473 的磷酸化刺激 PDK1 对苏氨酸残基 Thr308 的 Akt 磷酸化，并导致 Akt 完全激活。 此外，mTORC2 表现出酪氨酸蛋白激酶活性，并分别磷酸化酪氨酸残基 Tyr1131/1136 和 Tyr1146/1151 上的胰岛素样生长因子 1 受体 (IGF-IR) 和胰岛素受体 (InsR)，导致 IGF 完全激活-IR 和 InsR.

##### Inhibition by rapamycin 
Rapamycin inhibits mTORC1, and this appears to provide most of the beneficial effects of the drug (including life-span extension in animal studies). Rapamycin has a more complex effect on mTORC2, inhibiting it only in certain cell types under prolonged exposure. Disruption of mTORC2 produces the diabetic-like symptoms of decreased glucose tolerance and insensitivity to insulin. 
### PTEN 
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a phosphatase, in humans, is encoded by the PTEN gene. Mutations of this gene are a step in the development of many cancers, specifically glioblastoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Genes corresponding to PTEN (orthologs) have been identified in most mammals for which complete genome data are available. PTEN acts as a tumor suppressor gene through the action of its phosphatase protein product. This phosphatase is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, preventing cells from growing and dividing too rapidly. It is a target of many anticancer drugs. **The protein encoded by this gene is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase**. It contains a tensin-like domain as well as a catalytic domain similar to that of the dual specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases. Unlike most of the protein tyrosine phosphatases, this protein preferentially dephosphorylates phosphoinositide substrates. It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the Akt/PKB signaling pathway. 磷酸酶和张力蛋白同源物 (PTEN) 是一种磷酸酶，在人类中由 PTEN 基因编码。 该基因的突变是许多癌症发展的一个步骤，特别是胶质母细胞瘤、肺癌、乳腺癌和前列腺癌。与 PTEN（直向同源物）相对应的基因已在大多数哺乳动物中被鉴定出来，并且可以获得完整的基因组数据。 PTEN 通过其磷酸酶蛋白产物的作用充当肿瘤抑制基因。这种磷酸酶参与细胞周期的调节，防止细胞生长和分裂过快。 它是许多抗癌药物的靶点。 该基因编码的蛋白质是磷脂酰肌醇-3,4,5-三磷酸 3-磷酸酶。它包含一个张力蛋白样结构域以及一个类似于双特异性蛋白酪氨酸磷酸酶的催化​​结构域。与大多数蛋白质酪氨酸磷酸酶不同，这种蛋白质优先使磷酸肌醇底物去磷酸化。它负向调节细胞内磷脂酰肌醇-3,4,5-三磷酸的水平，并通过负向调节 Akt/PKB 信号通路起到抑癌作用。

In enzymology, a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.67) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate + H2O ⇌ phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate + phosphate Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphate. This enzyme class belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include PTEN, MMAC1, and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphohydrolase. PTEN also refers to a member of the class, phosphatase and tensin homolog. This enzyme class participates in 10 metabolic pathways: inositol phosphate metabolism, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, p53 signaling pathway, focal adhesion, tight junction, endometrial cancer, glioma, prostate cancer, melanoma, and small cell lung cancer. It employs one cofactor, magnesium. 在酶学中，磷脂酰肌醇-3,4,5-三磷酸 3-磷酸酶 (EC 3.1.3.67) 是一种催化化学反应的酶 磷脂酰肌醇 3,4,5-三磷酸 + H2O⇌磷脂酰肌醇 4,5-二磷酸 + 磷酸盐 因此，该酶的两种**底物是磷脂酰肌醇 3,4,5-三磷酸和 H2O**，而其两种**产物是磷脂酰肌醇 4,5-二磷酸和磷酸**。 该酶类属于水解酶家族，特别是那些作用于磷酸单酯键的酶。该酶类的系统名称是 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphohydrolase。其他常用名称包括 PTEN、 MMAC1 和磷脂酰肌醇-3,4,5-三磷酸 3-磷酸水解酶。 PTEN 也指磷酸酶和张力蛋白同系物的成员。该酶类参与 10 种代谢途径：磷酸肌醇代谢、磷脂酰肌醇信号系统、p53 信号通路、粘着斑、紧密连接、子宫内膜癌、神经胶质瘤、前列腺癌、黑色素瘤和小细胞肺癌。它使用一种辅助因子，镁。

PtdIns(4,5)P2 is enriched at the plasma membrane where it is a substrate for a number of important signaling proteins. PIP2 is formed primarily by the type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases from PI(4)P. In metazoans, PIP2 can also be formed by type II phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinases from PI(5)P. The fatty acids of PIP2 are variable in different species and tissues, but the most common fatty acids are stearic in position 1 and arachidonic in 2. PIP2 is a part of many cellular signaling pathways, including PIP2 cycle, PI3K signalling, and PI5P metabolism. Recently, it has been found in the nucleus with unknown function. 磷脂酰肌醇 4,5-二磷酸或 PtdIns(4,5)P2，也简称为 PIP2 或 PI(4,5)P2，是**细胞膜的次要磷脂成分**。 PtdIns(4,5)P2 在质膜处富集，在那里它**是许多重要信号蛋白的底物**。 PIP2 主要由来自 PI(4)P 的 I 型磷脂酰肌醇 4-磷酸 5-激酶形成。 在后生动物中，PIP2 也可以由来自 PI(5)P 的 II 型磷脂酰肌醇 5-磷酸 4-激酶形成。 PIP2 的脂肪酸在不同物种和组织中是可变的，但最常见的脂肪酸是位置 1 的硬脂酸和位置 2 的花生四烯酸。 
##### Functions 
###### Cytoskeleton dynamics near membranes 
PIP2 regulates the organization, polymerization, and branching of filamentous actin (F-actin) via direct binding to F-actin regulatory proteins. 
###### Endocytosis and exocytosis 胞吞作用和胞吐作用 
The first evidence that indicated phosphoinositides(PIs) (especially PI(4,5)P2) are important during the exocytosis process was in 1990. Emberhard et al. found that the application of PI-specific phospholipase C into digitonin-permeabilized chromaffin cells decreased PI levels, and inhibited calcium-triggered exocytosis. This exocytosis inhibition was preferential for an ATP-dependent stage, indicating PI function was required for secretion. Later studies identified associated proteins necessary during this stage, such as phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, and phosphoinositol-4-monophosphatase 5 kinase type Iγ (PIPKγ), which mediates PI(4,5)P2 restoration in permeable cell incubation in an ATP-dependent way. In these later studies, PI(4,5)P2 specific antibodies strongly inhibited exocytosis, thus providing direct evidence that PI(4,5)P2 plays a pivotal role during the LDCV (Large dense core vesicle) exocytosis process. 磷酸肌醇 (PI)（尤其是 PI(4,5)P2）在胞吐过程中很重要的第一个证据是在 1990 年。 Emberhard 等人。 发现将 PI 特异性磷脂酶 C 应用于毛地黄皂苷渗透的嗜铬细胞会降低 PI 水平，并抑制钙触发的胞吐作用。这种胞吐作用抑制优先于 ATP 依赖性阶段，表明分泌需要 PI 功能。后来的研究确定了此阶段所需的相关蛋白质，例如磷脂酰肌醇转移蛋白，和磷酸肌醇-4-单磷酸酶 5 激酶 I 型 (PIPKγ)，介导渗透细胞培养中的 PI(4,5)P2 恢复以 ATP 依赖的方式。在这些后来的研究中，PI(4,5)P2 特异性抗体强烈抑制胞吐作用，从而提供直接证据表明 PI(4,5)P2 在 LDCV（大密集核心囊泡）胞吐作用过程中起着关键作用。 Through the use of PI-specific kinase/phosphatase identification and PI antibody/drug/blocker discovery, the role of PI (especially PI(4,5)P2) in secretion regulation was extensively investigated. Studies utilizing PHPLCδ1 domain over-expression (acting as PI(4,5)P2 buffer or blocker), PIPKIγ knockout in chromaffin cell and in central nerve system, PIPKIγ knockdown in beta cell lines, and over-expression of membrane-tethered inositol 5-phosphatase domain of synaptojanin 1, all suggested vesicle (synaptic vesicle and LDCV) secretion were severely impaired after PI(4,5)P2 depletion or blockage. Moreover, some studies showed an impaired/reduced RRP of those vesicles, though the docked vesicle number were not altered after PI(4,5)P2 depletion, indicating a defect at a pre-fusion stage (priming stage). Follow-up studies indicated that PI(4,5)P2 interactions with CAPS,[15] Munc13 and synaptotagmin1 are likely to play a role in this PI(4,5)P2 dependent priming defect. 
###### IP3/DAG pathway 
PIP2 functions as an intermediate in the IP3/DAG pathway, which is initiated by ligands binding to G protein-coupled receptors activating the Gq alpha subunit. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is a substrate for hydrolysis by phospholipase C (PLC), a membrane-bound enzyme activated through protein receptors such as α1 adrenergic receptors. PIP2 regulates the function of many membrane proteins and ion channels, such as the M-channel. The products of the PLC catalyzation of PIP2 are inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3; IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), both of which function as second messengers. In this cascade, DAG remains on the cell membrane and activates the signal cascade by activating protein kinase C (PKC). PKC in turn activates other cytosolic proteins by phosphorylating them. The effect of PKC could be reversed by phosphatases. IP3 enters the cytoplasm and activates IP3 receptors on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which opens calcium channels on the smooth ER, allowing mobilization of calcium ions through specific Ca2+ channels into the cytosol. Calcium participates in the cascade by activating other proteins. PIP2 作为 IP3/DAG 通路的中间体发挥作用，该通路由配体结合 G 蛋白偶联受体激活 Gq α 亚基启动。 PtdIns(4,5)P2 是磷脂酶 C (PLC) 水解的底物，磷脂酶 C (PLC) 是一种通过蛋白质受体（如 α1 肾上腺素能受体）激活的膜结合酶。 PIP2 调节许多膜蛋白和离子通道（如 M 通道）的功能。 PIP2 的 PLC 催化产物是肌醇 1,4,5-三磷酸 (InsP3; IP3) 和二酰基甘油 (DAG)，这两者都起到第二信使的作用。在这个级联中，DAG 保留在细胞膜上并通过激活蛋白激酶 C (PKC) 来激活信号级联。 PKC 反过来通过磷酸化其他胞质蛋白来激活它们。 PKC 的作用可以被磷酸酶逆转。 IP3 进入细胞质并激活平滑内质网 (ER) 上的 IP3 受体，这会打开平滑 ER 上的钙通道，允许钙离子通过特定的 Ca2+ 通道移动到细胞质中。钙通过激活其他蛋白质参与级联反应。

###### Docking phospholipids 
Class I PI 3-kinases phosphorylate PtdIns(4,5)P2 forming phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and PtdIns(4,5)P2 can be converted from PtdIns4P. PtdIns4P, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 not only act as substrates for enzymes but also serve as docking phospholipids that bind specific domains that promote the recruitment of proteins to the plasma membrane and subsequent activation of signaling cascades. - Examples of proteins activated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are AKT, PDPK1, Btk1. - One mechanism for direct effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is opening of Na+ channels as a minor function in growth hormone release by growth hormone-releasing hormone. 
###### Potassium channels 
Inwardly rectifying potassium channels have been shown to require docking of PIP2 for channel activity. 
###### G protein-coupled receptors 
PtdIns(4,5)P2 has been shown to stabilize the active states of Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) via direct binding, and enhance their selectivity toward certain G proteins. 
###### G protein-coupled receptor kinases 
PIP2 has been shown to recruit G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) to the membrane by binding to the large lobe of GRK2. This stabilizes GRK2 and also orients it in a way that allows for more efficient phosphorylation of the beta adrenergic receptor, a type of GPCR.

### K17 and 14-3-3 sigma
in wild type K17, 14-3-3 is predominantly in cytoplasmic 
#### 第一篇 [链接](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25736868/) 
##### Purpose 
to clarify the **pattern of expression** of 14-3-3 sigma in comparison with that of K17 in epithelial dysplasia, CIS, and SCC, in oral mucosal tissue, as well as in oral SCC cells in culture. 
##### Background 
Recently, a novel function of K17 has been reported in wound healing of the skin, as it rapidly induced expression of 14-3-3 sigma and their association is essential in regeneration of epidermal cells [12]. As a member of a family of highly conserved 30-kDa acidic adaptor proteins, 14-3-3 sigma is involved in the **regulation of protein synthesis** and consequently cell growth in a wide range of tissues [19, 20]. Expression of 14-3-3 sigma is **upregulated by p53 in response to DNA damage** [21], and it has been considered a potential tumor suppressor gene. It **regulates the cell cycle by arresting the G2/M-phase checkpoint** [22]. Recently, it has been shown to bind to threonine 9 and serine 44 of the non-helical head domain of K17, which is required for **nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation** of 14-3-3 sigma [12]. Cytoplasmic translocation of 14-3-3 sigma might promote cell growth by stimulating mammalian target of rapamycin (**mTOR**) activity [23, 24], not only in neoplastic but also in inflammatory conditions 
##### Results 
We showed **co-localization of K17 and 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm of CIS and SCC** cells in tissue samples as well as in SCC cells in culture. As in the absence of K17 in K17-knockdown cells, 14-3-3 sigma translocated to the nucle- us along with inhibition of growth and cell size, we postulate that cytoplasmic but not nuclear 14-3-3 sigma promotes cell growth and cell size, possibly in association with the mTOR signaling pathway as previously proposed by Kim et al. [12] We used a siRNA approach to knock down K17. We therefore suggest that K17 might be a target molecule for an RNAi therapeutic approach in oral SCC because its expression is specific in various kinds of carcinoma, especially SCC and even in CIS. Recently, GeneCream, a lipid/alcohol base siRNA cream (produced by TransDerm Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), has been shown to be able to penetrate into the dermis in mice and reduce both mRNA and protein levels of osteopontin [48] in addition to the use of 14-3-3 sigma and K17 immunohistochemistry in the **diagnosis of oral CIS and SCC,** they might provide **targets for new therapeutic approaches** for oral superficial carcinoma complexes, because most of them are treated by re- peated surgery, which considerably degrades the quality of life in patients. 
#### 第二篇( 第一篇的引用 [12] ) [链接](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04659) 
##### Purpose 
understand why K17-null (K17-/-) mouse embryos[4] show a delay in the closure of surface ectoderm wounds 
##### Background 
After injury to skin, wound-proximal epithelial cells increase in size, decrease in adhesiveness and polarize, concomitant共存的 with changes in protein regulation and gene expression. Among the keratin intermediate filament genes rapidly **upregulated in wound-activated skin epithelial cells** are K6, K16 and K17. Such wound-induced alterations in intermediate filament proteins probably alter cellular viscoelastic弹性的 properties in a manner that optimizes tissue repair. In light of the large **number of signalling proteins already known** to interact with intermediate filaments[5,8], these cytoskeletal fibres are well-placed **to fulfill additional, non-mechanical functions during tissue repair and homeostasis**. 
##### Experiments Evidence 
1. analysed the surface ectoderm外胚层 in embryonic day (E)11.5 **mouse embryos**. In wild- type embryos, **wound-proximal epithelial cells upregulate K179 and become significantly enlarged compared** to intact tissue. This hypertrophic response is **markedly blunted in K17-/- embryos**. 2. Cellular **hypertrophy,** along with K6, K16 and K17 upregulation, also occurs in primary **cultures of keratinocytes**. > whether lack of K17 alters bulk protein translation and the activity of key regulators. 3. Compared to wild-type cells, cultured **K17-/- keratinocytes have a 15% slower rate of amino acid incorporation into newly synthesized proteins** , and a 73% slower rate of peptide chain elongation. **mTOR and Akt activity are also significantly decreased in K17-/- cells** compared to wild-type cells, whereas **PI(3)K activity is unaffected**, suggesting that K17 acts downstream of PI(3)K activation in this pathway. * We conclude that the protein synthesis and growth defects in K17-/- cells are specifically associated with down- regulation of the Akt/mTOR pathway. 4. **Treatment with rapamycin, a potent mTOR inhibitor**, reduces the rate of translation by 22% in wild-type cells and to a lesser extent (7%) in K17-/- cells, as expected * Upon serum removal, protein synthesis reaches the same low rate in K17-/- and wild-type cells . Serum readdition causes dramatic stimulation of protein synthesis over 60 min in wild-type keratinocytes. In comparison, the **stimulatory effect of serum on protein synthesis was consistently ,15% lower in K17-/- keratinocytes** * This **depression in translation is also reflected in Akt/mTOR signalling**. In wild-type cells, Akt and mTOR are robustly activated upon serum stimulation over at least 150min. K17-/- cells show marked activation of Akt 60 min after serum addition, but not at 150 min, and the activity of mTOR remains low in K17-/- keratinocytes after serum addition * Although an effect on upstream events cannot be ruled out, these findings i**mply that loss of K17 primarily affects one or more steps downstream of Akt activation**. Given that mTOR can activate Akt15 (probably as part of a feedback regulatory mechanism), **reduced mTOR activation could account for the decreased steady-state activity of Akt** in K17-/- cells 5. To identify K17-binding proteins that might provide mechanistic insight into this growth defect, we set up a biochemical screen using a reversible chemical crosslinker in cultured skin keratinocytes. > When "crosslinking" is used in the biological field, it refers to the use of a probe to link proteins together to check for protein–protein interactions, as well as other creative cross-linking methodologies. * We identified 14-3-3 sigma (also known as stratifin), an epithelial-specific isoform of 14-3-3 (ref. 16), as a specific K17-binding protein in keratinocytes. 14-3-3 proteins regulate many cellular processes by altering the conformation, activity or subcellular localization of target proteins, which they bind in a Ser/Thr-phosphorylation-dependent manner * Total 14-3-3 protein levels are similar in wild-type and K17-/- keratinocytes. In wild-type keratinocytes grown in serum- containing growth medium, 14-3-3σ is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, but it is **found predominantly in the nucleus of K17-/- cells** . Indeed, 14-3-3 proteins redistribute to the nucleus after serum withdrawal in wild-type cultures, and serum treatment causes them to shift back to the cytoplasm. This correlates with increases in K17 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. Such findings suggest a model in which K17 phosphorylation is required for the retention of 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm upon serum stimulation. 6. Identifying the amino acid residue(s) mediating 14-3-3 binding to K17 * Two consensus 14-3-3-binding sites, threonine 9 (Thr 9) and serine 44 (Ser 44), are present in the non-helical head domain of K17 (Supplementary Fig. 4a). We mutated these sites to alanine residues and transfected the mutant DNA constructs into BHK fibroblasts. Relative to wild-type K17, T9A and S44A single mutants and the double mutant T9A/S44A show significantly reduced 14-3-3 binding * To test for phenotypic rescue, we transiently transfected K17-/- keratinocytes with **wild-type K17, K17(T9A/S44A) or green fluorescent protein (GFP)** as a control. Expression of wild-type K17 increases cytoplasmic 14-3-3 levels and Akt/mTOR activity, increases the rate of protein synthesis by 30% (Fig. 4d) and results in an increased surface area of K17-/- cells   
#### Stratifin/14-3-3σ (cell cycle checkpoint protein) 
also known as 14-3-3 protein sigma or 14-3-3σ protein) is a protein encoded by the SFN gene in humans. The protein is named for its presence in stratified epithelial cells. This gene **encodes a cell cycle checkpoint protein**. The encoded protein binds to translation and initiation factors and functions as a regulator of mitotic translation. In response to DNA damage this protein plays a role in preventing DNA errors during mitosis. 也称为 14-3-3 蛋白 sigma 或 14-3-3σ 蛋白）是一种由人类 SFN 基因编码的蛋白质。 该蛋白质因其在分层上皮细胞中的存在而得名。 该基因**编码细胞周期检查点蛋白**。 编码的蛋白质与翻译和起始因子结合，并作为有丝分裂翻译的调节剂发挥作用。 为了应对 DNA 损伤，这种蛋白质在有丝分裂期间防止 DNA 错误中发挥作用。 [p53 and 14-3-3σ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14517281/) The 14-3-3 sigma (sigma) protein, a negative regulator of the cell cycle, is a human mammary epithelium-specific marker that is downregulated in transformed mammary carcinoma cells. It has also been identified as a p53-inducible gene product involved in cell cycle checkpoint control after DNA damage. Although 14-3-3 sigma is linked to p53-regulated cell cycle checkpoint control, detailed mechanisms of how cell cycle regulation occurs remain unclear. Decreased expression of 14-3-3 sigma was recently reported in several types of carcinomas, further suggesting that the negative regulatory role of 14-3-3 sigma in the cell cycle is compromised during tumorigenesis. However, this possible tumor-suppressive role of 14-3-3 sigma has not yet been characterized. Here, we studied the link between 14-3-3 sigma activities and p53 regulation. We found that 14-3-3 sigma interacted with p53 in response to the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin. Importantly, 14-3-3 sigma expression led to stabilized expression of p53. In studying the molecular mechanism of this increased stabilization of p53, we found that 14-3-3 sigma antagonized the biological functions of Mdm2 by blocking Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and nuclear export. In addition, we found that 14-3-3 sigma facilitated the oligomerization of p53 and enhanced p53's transcriptional activity. As a target gene of p53, 14-3-3 sigma appears to have a positive feedback effect on p53 activity. Significantly, we also showed that overexpression of 14-3-3 sigma inhibited oncogene-activated tumorigenicity in a tetracycline-regulated 14-3-3 sigma system. These results defined an important p53 regulatory loop and suggested that 14-3-3 sigma expression can be considered for therapeutic intervention in cancers. 14-3-3 sigma (sigma) 蛋白是细胞周期的负调节因子，是一种人类乳腺上皮特异性标志物，在转化的乳腺癌细胞中下调。它也被确定为 p53 诱导基因产物，参与 DNA 损伤后的细胞周期检查点控制。尽管 14-3-3 sigma 与 p53 调节的细胞周期检查点控制有关，但细胞周期调节如何发生的详细机制仍不清楚。最近在几种类型的癌症中报道了 14-3-3 sigma 的表达降低，进一步表明 14-3-3 sigma 在细胞周期中的负调节作用在肿瘤发生过程中受到损害。然而，14-3-3 西格玛的这种可能的肿瘤抑制作用尚未得到表征。在这里，我们研究了 14-3-3 西格玛活动与 p53 调节之间的联系。我们发现 14-3-3 sigma 与 p53 相互作用以响应 DNA 损伤剂阿霉素。重要的是，14-3-3 sigma 表达导致 p53 的稳定表达。在研究这种增加 p53 稳定性的分子机制时，我们发现 14-3-3 sigma 通过阻断 Mdm2 介导的 p53 泛素化和核输出来拮抗 Mdm2 的生物学功能。此外，我们发现 14-3-3 sigma 促进了 p53 的寡聚化并增强了 p53 的转录活性。作为 p53 的靶基因，14-3-3 sigma 似乎对 p53 活性具有正反馈效应。值得注意的是，我们还表明，在四环素调节的 14-3-3 sigma 系统中，14-3-3 sigma 的过表达抑制了致癌基因激活的致瘤性。这些结果定义了一个重要的 p53 调节环，并表明 14-3-3 sigma 表达可以考虑用于癌症的治疗干预。 
### K17 and p27 
We investigated the mechanistic basis for the biologic impact of K17 through loss- and gain-of-function experiments in human cervix, breast, and pancreatic cancer cells. Specifically, we determined that K17 functions as an oncoprotein by regulating the subcellular localization and degradation of p27KIP1. We found that K17 was released from intermediate filaments and translocated into the nucleus via a nuclear localization signal (NLS), specific among keratins, where it bound p27KIP1 during G1 phase of the cell cycle. p27KIP1 lacks a nuclear export signal (NES) and requires an adaptor for CRM1 binding for nuclear export. In K17, we defined and validated a leucine-rich NES that mediated CRM1 binding for export. Cervical cancer cells expressing K17 mutations in its NLS or NES signals exhibited an increase in levels of nuclear p27KIP1, whereas cells expressing wild-type K17 exhibited a depletion in total endogenous p27KIP1. In clinical specimens of cervical cancer, we confirmed that the expressions of K17 and p27KIP1 were inversely correlated, both across tumors and within individual tumors. Overall, our findings establish that K17 functions specially among keratins as an oncoprotein by controlling the ability of p27KIP1 to influence cervical cancer pathogenesis. 我们通过人类宫颈癌细胞、乳腺癌和胰腺癌细胞的功能丧失和功能获得实验研究了 K17 生物学影响的机制基础。具体而言，我们通过调节 p27KIP1 的亚细胞定位和降解来确定 K17 作为癌蛋白发挥作用。我们发现 K17 从中间丝中释放并通过核定位信号 (NLS) 转移到细胞核中，在角蛋白中具有特异性，它在细胞周期的 G1 期结合 p27KIP1。 p27KIP1 缺乏核输出信号 (NES)，需要用于 CRM1 结合核输出的适配器。在 K17 中，我们定义并验证了一种富含亮氨酸的 NES，可介导 CRM1 绑定以进行导出。在其 NLS 或 NES 信号中表达 K17 突变的宫颈癌细胞表现出核 p27KIP1 水平的增加，而表达野生型 K17 的细胞表现出总内源性 p27KIP1 的消耗。在宫颈癌的临床标本中，我们证实 K17 和 p27KIP1 的表达呈负相关，无论是跨肿瘤还是在单个肿瘤内。总的来说，我们的研究结果表明，K17 通过控制 p27KIP1 影响宫颈癌发病机制的能力，在角蛋白中作为癌蛋白发挥特殊作用。 Our data suggest that K17 mediates cancer cell-cycle progression and tumor growth by promoting p27KIP1 nuclear export and degradation. After mitogen signaling during early G1, p27KIP1 is actively exported from the nucleus in a CRM1-dependent manner and is degraded by the KIP1 ubiquitination–promoting complex, triggering G1–S transition 
### FGF-2  
Activated FGFRs phosphorylate FRS2a and FRS2a binds to SH2 domain-containing adaptor Grb2. Grb2 will subsequently bind to SOS, GAB1, and Cbl through its SH3 domain to activate Ras/Raf/MAPKs, including ERK MAPK, p38 MAPK, and JNK MAPK. The activated FGFRs also activate phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase and STAT. FGFRs recruit and phosphorylate PLCγ. Among the members of the FGF synexpression group, SEF and XFLRT3 are transmembrane proteins and can interact directly with FGFRs. SEF functions as a negative regulator by affecting the phosphorylation of the MAPK ERK cascade. XFLRT3 forms a complex with FGF receptors and enhances FGF/FGFR signaling. Spry acts at the level of Grb2 and/or the level of Raf to attenuate FGF/FGFR signaling. MKP3 negatively regulates FGF/FGFR signaling by dephosphorylating the activated ERK.

In addition, microwaving is prone to remove some delicate biopsies from poly-lysine slides, especially if they have already been antigen retrieved by a previous heat-mediated procedure. Another approach for preventing cross-reactivity in mIHC detection is **antibody elution**. A number of buffers with different pH, osmolarity, detergent content and denaturing properties were tested to strip the already bound antibody complex from previous IHC staining cycles. Glycine-HCl/ sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) pH2 or 2-mercaptoethanol/SDS pH 6.75 was reported to **be effective by one group but not the other.** In addition, certain buffers were found to be hazardous, decolorized H&E stain and/or reduced nuclear protein target staining. We present here a fully automated mIHC technology using a **thermochemical process** to deactivate antibody complex between staining cycles on a commercial automated slide stainer. This technology allows the use of 1°Abs from the same species, detected by the anti- species 2°Abs conjugated to HRP, which in turn drives in-situ deposition of tyramide-fluorophores (Ty-fluor). ### 抄袭的review Technical approaches of brightfield chromogenic mIHC include direct detection of antigens by primary antibodies from the same or different species that are directly labeled with different chromogens. Alternatively, an indirect mIHC detection method can be used with two or more layers of antibodies, allowing for increased amplification of signal. The direct detection approach has several disadvantages, such as lower sensitivity for low abundance targets, the need for sizeable quantities of conjugated antibodies, which are usually more expensive, and the risk that antibody activity could be adversely affected by direct labeling. The **indirect approach can be limited by the number of available host species and the use of same species antibodies, which would thus require inactivation between successive cycles of immunolabeling** [24]. 明场显色 mIHC 的技术方法包括通过直接用不同色原标记的相同或不同物种的一抗直接检测抗原。 或者，间接 mIHC 检测方法可用于两层或多层抗体，从而增加信号放大 [24]。 直接检测方法有几个缺点，例如对低丰度目标的灵敏度较低，需要大量偶联抗体（通常更昂贵），以及直接标记可能对抗体活性产生不利影响的风险 [24]。 间接方法可能受到可用宿主物种数量和相同物种抗体的使用的限制，因此需要在连续免疫标记循环之间灭活 [24]。 The unwanted cross-reactivity between primary antibodies from different staining cycles is regarded as the main technical challenge in mIHC. The most frequent solution used to avoid such reactions is manual microwaving or heating of tissue slides to deactivate the preceding antibody [25,26]. Whereas **microwaving is often used in research facilities when dealing with antibodies from the same host-species**, it may **not be an optimal method** to be adopted in a routine clinical setting. Variable and heterogeneous results could be obtained by manual processing. Furthermore, microwaving can increase the damage of the tumor tissue and may remove small biopsies from the slides, especially if they have already been antigen retrieved by a previous heat-mediated procedure [27]. 来自不同染色周期的一抗之间不需要的交叉反应被认为是 mIHC 的主要技术挑战。 用于避免此类反应的最常见解决方案是手动微波或加热组织载玻片以停用前述抗体 [25,26]。 虽然在研究机构中处理来自同一宿主物种的抗体时经常使用微波，但它可能不是常规临床环境中采用的最佳方法。 可以通过手动处理获得可变和异质的结果。 此外，微波会增加对肿瘤组织的损伤，并可能从载玻片上去除小活检，特别是如果它们已经通过先前的热介导程序获得了抗原[27]。 Another strategy for preventing cross-reactivity is the use of **stripping buffers to elute the primary/secondary antibody** complex [27,28]. A number of buffers with different pH, osmolality, detergent content and denaturing features were evaluated to strip the bound antibody complex from previous IHC staining cycles, however this **produced variable results across studies**. Certain buffers were found to be **hazardous**, to decolorize H&E stain and/or to **reduce nuclear protein staining** [27,28]. 另一种防止交叉反应的策略是使用剥离缓冲液洗脱一抗/二抗复合物 [27,28]。 评估了许多具有不同 pH、渗透压、洗涤剂含量和变性特征的缓冲液，以从之前的 IHC 染色周期中去除结合的抗体复合物，但是这在研究中产生了不同的结果。 发现某些缓冲液是有害的，会使 H&E 染色脱色和/或减少核蛋白染色 [27,28]。 An alternative, more recent approach named **“multiplexed immunohistochemical consecutive staining on single slide”** (MICSSS), was developed for use on FFPE samples by applying repetitive cycles of immunoperoxidase labeling, image scanning, then chemical stripping of the chromogenic substrate [20,21]. However, this process can result in a **labor-intensive protocol** and a prolonged turnaround time to yield results that are not suitable for a routine clinical setting. Moreover, multiplexing may be limited due to tissue degradation after successive serial mIHC cycles [24,29]. More recently, a fully automated mIHC technology using a thermochemical process **(heat deactivation; HD) to deactivate an antibody complex between staining cycles** on an automated slide stainer was first developed for fluorescent detection, and further applied to brightfield chromogenic detection (Figure 1) [30,31]. 一种名为“单载玻片上的多重免疫组织化学连续染色”(MICSSS) 的替代方法被开发用于 FFPE 样品，方法是应用免疫过氧化物酶标记、图像扫描的重复循环，然后化学剥离显色底物 [20,21] . 然而，此过程可能会导致劳动密集型协议和延长的周转时间，从而产生不适合常规临床环境的结果。 此外，由于在连续连续的 mIHC 循环后组织退化，多路复用可能会受到限制 [24,29]。最近，首次开发了一种全自动 mIHC 技术，该技术使用热化学过程（热失活；HD）在自动载玻片染色机上的染色周期之间使抗体复合物失活，用于荧光检测，并进一步应用于明场显色检测（图 1）[ 30,31]。 This technology allows the use of the first antibody from the same host species, detected by the anti-species secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In the presence of its substrate, the active HRP, generates in-situ deposition of tyramide within the medium containing the chromogens. The bound primary antibody/secondary antibody complex is then eluted with a citrate/acetate buffer. Thus, the deposited chromogen-conjugated tyramide bounds covalently to the tissue near the first detected antigen. The same procedure is repeated to detect the following antigens [30,31]. Indeed, the sequential stripping may lead to wastage of the conjugated secondary antibodies, whereas the chromogen-conjugated tyramine remains stable by binding covalently to the electron-rich amino acids of detected proteins and by resisting to the elution with the stripping buffer [30,31]. Importantly, the automation allows for standardization of all critical mIHC steps, such as HD, reagent application, washing steps, control of temperatures, evaporation and humidity, while maintaining the integrity of the tissue architecture and the subsequent epitopes [32,33]. 该技术允许使用来自同一宿主物种的一抗，通过与辣根过氧化物酶 (HRP) 偶联的抗物种二抗进行检测。在其底物存在的情况下，活性 HRP 在含有色原的介质中产生酪酰胺的原位沉积。然后用柠檬酸盐/乙酸盐缓冲液洗脱结合的一抗/二抗复合物。因此，沉积的色原偶联酪胺与第一个检测到的抗原附近的组织共价结合。重复相同的程序以检测以下抗原 [30,31]。事实上，顺序剥离可能导致偶联二抗的浪费，而色原偶联酪胺通过共价结合检测蛋白质的富电子氨基酸并抵抗剥离缓冲液的洗脱而保持稳定 [30,31 ]。重要的是，自动化允许标准化所有关键的 mIHC 步骤，例如 HD、试剂应用、洗涤步骤、温度控制、蒸发和湿度，同时保持组织结构和后续表位的完整性 [32,33]。 To setup a brightfield mIHC assay using sequential detection with unmodified primary antibodies and chromogenic detection, it is essential to optimize assay conditions on the tissue types of interest before testing clinical samples [34]. Thus, an optimal mIHC assay needs to assure several staining performances: (i) equivalent positive/negative signal to single “gold standard” IHC staining, (ii) robust dynamic proportion of low and high protein quantity, (iii) expected cellular staining topology (e.g., whole membrane, cytoplasmic, nuclear localization), and (iv) minimal overlap of chromogenic spectra for co-localized targets [34]. Recent developments have enabled optimal configurations suitable for testing on clinical samples. For instance, **the order of chromogen deposition is determined by the effect of HD on each epitope, that is, the most HD-affected epitope is incubated first, with the least affected epitope incubated last.** 要使用未修饰的一抗和显色检测的顺序检测来设置明场 mIHC 检测，必须在测试临床样本之前优化目标组织类型的检测条件 [34]。 因此，最佳的 mIHC 检测需要确保多种染色性能：(i) 与单一“金标准”IHC 染色等效的阳性/阴性信号，(ii) 低蛋白和高蛋白量的稳健动态比例，(iii) 预期的细胞染色拓扑 （例如，全膜、细胞质、核定位）和（iv）共定位目标的显色光谱重叠最小[34]。 最近的发展已经实现了适用于临床样本测试的最佳配置。 例如，色原沉积的顺序取决于 HD 对每个表位的影响，即最受 HD 影响的表位首先孵育，最后孵育受影响最小的表位。 To offer the best detection sensitivity, other assay parameters must be taken into account such as the **optimal epitope retrieval time to balance the signal/background ratio,** and **to protect the tissue architecture by optimizing the incubation time for each primary antibody** [30]. Moreover, the number of antibodies for simultaneous immunolabeling on the same tissue slide has been extended up to six with the availability of additional chromogens [24,33]. In addition, a major technical challenge is the risk of insufficient deactivation of the primary antibody complexes, which could determine cross-reactions and may give false-positive signals. Besides efforts to optimize HD steps during assay validation, the imaging tools can help to anticipate or to detect potential cross-reactions [35]. 为了提供最佳检测灵敏度，必须考虑其他检测参数，例如最佳表位修复时间以平衡信号/背景比，并通过优化每个一抗的孵育时间来保护组织结构 [30]。 此外，随着额外色原的可用性，用于在同一组织载玻片上同时进行免疫标记的抗体数量已扩展至六种 [24,33]。 此外，一个主要的技术挑战是初级抗体复合物失活不足的风险，这可能会确定交叉反应并可能产生假阳性信号。 除了在检测验证期间优化 HD 步骤之外，成像工具还可以帮助预测或检测潜在的交叉反应 [35]。 ## Ventana Discovery #### anti -Rabbit NP DISCOVERY anti-Rabbit NP is a *goat anti rabbit polyclonal antibody* **hapten-labeled with NP (Nitropyrazole)** to be detected by DISCOVERY anti-NP AP (760-4827, 07425325001).

### Hallmarks of Cancer 
#### Abstract 
The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep develop- ment of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and acti- vating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hall- mark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hall- mark traits by creating the ‘‘tumor microenvironment.’’ Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. 在人类肿瘤发生和发展过程中，肿瘤逐渐获得了包括6个生物学能力在内的标志性特征。这些特征构成 了解释肿瘤疾病复杂性的组织原则。这些标志性特征包括:持续的增殖信号，回避生长抑制调控，抗 细胞凋亡，永久复制能力，新生血管增生以及侵袭和转移。基因组的不稳定性和炎症是产生这些标志 性特征的遗传基础，基因组的不稳定性催生能加速标志性特征获取的遗传多样性，炎症则能够培养多 种标志性特征的功能。近十来的研究进展还发现了具有潜在普遍性意义的两个新发现的标志性特征- 细胞能量代谢的重编程和逃避免疫摧毁。除了癌症细胞，肿瘤还有另一层复杂性:他们储存了被募集 来的表面上正常的细胞，这些细胞通过创造“肿瘤微环境”对标志性特征的获取产生影响。对这些概念 的广泛应用的认知对研发新型肿瘤治疗方法有越来越大的影响。 ## Introduction We have proposed that six hallmarks of cancer together constitute an organizing principle that provides a logical framework for understanding the remarkable diversity of neoplastic diseases. Implicit in our discussion was the notion that as normal cells evolve progressively to a neoplastic state, they acquire a succession of these hallmark capabilities, and that the multistep process of human tumor pathogenesis could be rationalized by the need of incipient cancer cells to acquire the traits that enable them to become tumorigenic and ultimately malignant. 我们提出了癌症的六大标志性特征共同作为基本原理，它们为理 解肿瘤疾病独特的多样性提供了合理的构架。在我们的讨论中，暗含以下观点:在正常细胞逐步 演化至肿瘤状态的过程中，它们获得了一系列的标志性特征;早 期的癌症细胞需要获取这些性能以促使它们成瘤并最终恶化，这 可以合理解释人类肿瘤多阶段的发病进程。 We noted as an ancillary proposition that tumors are more than insular masses of proliferating cancer cells. Instead, they are complex tissues composed of multiple distinct cell types that participate in heterotypic interactions with one another. We depicted the recruited normal cells, which form tumor-associated stroma, as active participants in tumorigenesis rather than passive bystanders; as such, these stromal cells contribute to the development and expression of certain hallmark capabilities. During the ensuing decade this notion has been solidified and extended, revealing that the biology of tumors can no longer be understood simply by enumerating the traits of the cancer cells but instead must encompass the contributions of the ‘‘tumor microenvironment’’ to tumorigenesis. 此外我们发现，肿瘤不仅仅是一团孤立的不断增生的癌症细 胞。相反，它们是由多种类型不同的、彼此之间相互作用的细胞 组成的复合组织。我们认为参与其中并形成肿瘤相关基质的正常 细胞，在成瘤过程中并非被动的旁观者而是主动的参与者。因 此，这些基质细胞为某些标志性特征的发展和表现做出了贡献。 在最近的十年，这一观点得到了巩固和延伸，揭示出肿瘤生物学 不能再被简单地理解为癌症细胞各种特性的罗列，而是必须包 含“肿瘤微环境”对肿瘤发生的贡献。 In the course of remarkable progress in cancer research subsequent to this publication, new observations have served both to clarify and to modify the original formulation of the hallmark capabilities. In addition, yet other observations have raised questions and highlighted mechanistic concepts that were not integral to our original elaboration of the hallmark traits. Motivated by these developments, we now revisit the original hall- marks, consider new ones that might be included in this roster, and expand upon the functional roles and contributions made by recruited stromal cells to tumor biology. 继上篇文献之后，在癌症研究领域取得显著进展的过程中，新 的发现对最初标志性特征的构想进行了廓清与修正。此外，还有 其他的发现提出了问题并且突出了之前没有整合到最初阐述的特 征中的概念。受到这些进展的鼓舞，我们如今回顾最初的特征， 考虑可能列入其中的新标志性特征，并且详述其功能和参与其中 的基质细胞对肿瘤生物学的贡献。 ## HALLMARK CAPABILITIES—CONCEPTUAL PROGRESS The six hallmarks of cancer—distinctive and complementary capabilities that enable tumor growth and metastatic dissemination—continue to provide a solid foundation for understanding the biology of cancer. In the first section of this Review, we summarize the essence of each hallmark as described in the original presentation in 2000, followed by selected illustrations (demarcated by sub-headings in italics) of the conceptual progress made over the past decade in understanding their mechanistic underpinnings. In subsequent sections we address new developments that broaden the scope of the conceptualization, describing in turn two enabling characteristics crucial to the acquisition of the six hallmark capabilities, two new emerging hallmark capabilities, the constitution and signaling interactions of the tumor microenvironment crucial to cancer phenotypes, and we finally discuss the new frontier of therapeutic application of these concepts. 肿瘤的六大特征 — 是能够促使肿瘤生长和转移扩散的各不相 同却互补的性能 — 依旧为理解癌症生物学提供着坚实的基础 (图1)。在本篇综述的第一部分，我们总结了在2000年那篇 综述中讲述的每一个特征的核心内容，接下来以选定的例证 (以副标题加以区分)描述过去十年中概念的进展以理解他们 的产生基础。在接下来的部分，我们阐述了能拓展概念范围的 新进展，它们依次描述了两种对六大标志性特征获取至关重要 的特性、两种新发现的标志性特征、对肿瘤表型至关重要的肿 瘤微环境的构成和互作作用，最后我们还讨论了这些概念在治 疗领域的新应用。 ![enter image description here](https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/cms/attachment/dde9795c-1d4d-42e4-95d3-2290870f2304/gr1.jpg) ## 1. Sustaining Proliferative Signaling Arguably the most fundamental trait of cancer cells involves their ability to sustain chronic proliferation. Normal tissues carefully control the production and release of growth-promoting signals that instruct entry into and progression through the cell growth- and-division cycle, thereby ensuring a homeostasis of cell number and thus maintenance of normal tissue architecture and function. Cancer cells, by deregulating these signals, become masters of their own destinies. The enabling signals are conveyed in large part by growth factors that bind cell-surface receptors, typically containing intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. The latter proceed to emit signals via branched intra- cellular signaling pathways that regulate progression through the cell cycle as well as cell growth (that is, increases in cell size); often these signals influence yet other cell-biological properties, such as cell survival and energy metabolism. 肿瘤细胞最基本的特性便是维持长期增殖的能力。生长促进信号 能指导细胞进入并推进生长和分裂周期，而正常组织会严密地控 制生长促进信号的生成和释放，从而保证了细胞数目的平衡以维 持正常组织的结构和功能。肿瘤细胞解除了这些信号的调控，进 而掌控了自己的命运。这些启动信号在很大程度上是通过结合在 细胞表面受体的生长因子来传递，这些受体通常在胞内含有酪氨 酸激酶功能域。后者继续通过细胞内信号通路来释放信号以调节 细胞周期和细胞生长(是指细胞大小的增加)的进程;通常这些 信号还会影响到其它的细胞生物学特性，例如细胞存活和能量代 谢。 Remarkably, the precise identities and sources of the proliferative signals operating within normal tissues were poorly understood a decade ago and in general remain so. Moreover, we still know relatively little about the mechanisms controlling the release of these mitogenic signals. In part, the understanding of these mechanisms is complicated by the fact that the **growth factor signals controlling cell number and position within tissues are thought to be transmitted in a temporally and spatially regulated fashion from one cell to its neighbors**; such paracrine signaling is difficult to access experimentally. In addition, the bioavailability生物利用度 of growth factors is regulated by sequestration in the pericellular space and extracellular matrix, and by the actions of a complex network of proteases, sulfatases, and possibly other enzymes that liberate and activate them, apparently in a **highly specific and localized fashion**. 值得注意的是，在正常组织中，这些增殖信号的明确成分和来 源在十年前所知甚少，如今依然如此。我们依然对调控分裂信号 释放的机制了解不多。在某种程度上，对这些机制的理解因为以 下事实而变得复杂:在组织内控制细胞数量和位置的生长因子信 号从一个细胞向邻近细胞传送的调控有一定的时空特异性。这种 旁分泌信号很难通过实验加以检验。此外，这些生长因子的生物 利用率受到以下因素调节:细胞周围空间和细胞外基质的截留， 释放和激活他们的蛋白酶、硫酸酯酶和其他酶所组成的复杂网络 的活动，它们显然有很高的特异性和区域性。 The mitogenic signaling in cancer cells is, in contrast, better understood. Cancer cells can acquire the capability to sustain proliferative signaling in a number of alternative ways: They may produce growth factor ligands themselves, to which they can respond via the **expression of cognate同源的 receptors**, resulting in **autocrine proliferative stimulation**. Alternatively, cancer cells may send signals to stimulate normal cells within the supporting tumor-associated stroma, which reciprocate by supplying the cancer cells with various growth factors. Receptor signaling can also be deregulated解除管制 by elevating the levels of receptor proteins displayed at the cancer cell surface, rendering such cells hyperresponsive to otherwise-limiting amounts of growth factor ligand; the same outcome can result from structural alterations in the receptor molecules that facilitate ligand-independent firing. 我们对肿瘤细胞中的分裂信号相比而言了解得更多。肿瘤细胞能通过多种方式获取 维持增殖信号的能力:它们自身能产生生长因子配体，通过同 源受体的表达来对配体产生应答，从而导致自分泌式的增殖刺 激。肿瘤细胞能传递信号刺激肿瘤相关基质中的正常细胞，正 常细胞反过来产生多种生长因子提供给肿瘤细胞。受体信号也能通过提升肿瘤细 胞表面的受体蛋白的水平，让这些细胞对原本数量有限的生长 因子配体过度应答而来摆脱控制;也能通过受体分子结构的改 变产生一样的效应，这种改变能摆脱配体限制而促进下游信号 的激活。 Growth factor independence may also derive from the constitutive activation of components of signaling pathways oper- ating downstream of these receptors, obviating the need to stimulate these pathways by ligand-mediated receptor activation. Given that a number of distinct downstream signaling pathways radiate from a ligand-stimulated receptor, the activa- tion of one or another of these downstream pathways, for example, the one responding to the Ras signal transducer, may only recapitulate a subset of the regulatory instructions transmitted by an activated receptor. 这些受体下游信号通路的组成型活化能摆脱生长因子的控制， 不需要配体介导的受体活化来激活这些通路。鉴于有许多不同的 下游信号通路受同一受体调控，这些下游通路的某一条通路的激活 — 例如，对Ras信号转导的响应 — 只能够代表一个活化受体 传递的调控指令的一小部分。 ### a. Somatic Mutations Activate Additional Downstream Pathways High-throughput DNA sequencing analyses of cancer cell genomes have revealed somatic mutations in certain human tumors that predict constitutive activation of signaling circuits usually triggered by activated growth factor receptors. Thus, we now know that $40% of human melanomas contain activating mutations affecting the structure of the B-Raf protein, resulting in constitutive signaling through the Raf to mitogen- activated protein (MAP)-kinase pathway. Similarly, mutations in the catalytic subunit of phosphoi- nositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) isoforms are being detected in an array of tumor types, which serve to hyperactivate the PI3- kinase signaling circuitry, including its key Akt/PKB signal transducer. The advantages to tumor cells of activating upstream (receptor) versus downstream (transducer) signaling remain obscure, as does the functional impact of crosstalk between the multiple pathways radiating from growth factor receptors. 对癌症细胞基因组的高通量测序分析揭示了某些人类肿瘤中的 体细胞突变，这些突变揭示信号环路的组成型激活通常是由活化 的生长因子受体引发。所以，我们现在知道40%的人类黑色素瘤 的诱因包含影响B-Raf蛋白结构的活性突变，导致了从Raf到有 丝分裂活化蛋白激酶(MAPK)通路信号的持续活化。在一系列肿瘤类型中都有检测到磷酸肌醇-3激 酶(PI3-Kinase)不同亚型催化亚基的突变。这些突变导致包括 其关键的Akt/PKB信号转导路径在内的PI3-Kinase信号环路的过 度激活。与下游 (转导器)信号的活化相比，肿瘤细胞上游信号(受体)活化的 优势依然不明朗，从同一生长因子受体引发的多个通路之间相互 交联的功能影响的优势也不明朗。 ### b. Disruptions of Negative-Feedback Mechanisms that Attenuate Proliferative Signaling Recent results have highlighted the importance of negative- feedback loops that normally operate to dampen various types of signaling and thereby ensure homeostatic regulation of the flux of signals coursing through the intracellular circuitry. Defects in these feedback mechanisms are capable of enhancing proliferative signaling. The prototype of this type of regulation involves the Ras oncoprotein: the oncogenic effects of Ras do not result from a hyperactivation of its signaling powers; instead, the oncogenic mutations affecting ras genes compromise Ras GTPase activity, which operates as an intrinsic negative-feedback mechanism that normally ensures that active signal transmission is transitory. 最新的结果凸显了负反馈循环的重要性，通常负反馈循环能抑制 多种类型的信号传递从而确保细胞内回路中信号流通的内平衡。这些反馈机制的破坏能提升增 殖信号。这种调控类型的一个范例便是Ras肿瘤蛋白: Ras 的致 瘤效应并非源自它的信号源的过度活化，而是影响ras基因的致 瘤突变减弱了Ras的GTP酶活性，这种GTP酶活性作为一种内在 的负反馈机制起作用，通常保证了活化信号的传递是短暂的。 Analogous negative-feedback mechanisms operate at multiple nodes within the proliferative signaling circuitry. A prominent example involves the PTEN phosphatase, which counteracts PI3-kinase by degrading its product, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PIP3). Loss-of-function mutations in PTEN amplify PI3K signaling and promote tumorigenesis in a variety of experimental models of cancer; in human tumors, PTEN expression is often lost by promoter methylation. 类似的负反馈机制在增殖信号环路的多个节点都发挥了作用。 一个著名的例子是关于PTEN磷酸酶，它能通过降解PI3激酶的产 物磷脂酰肌醇3,4,5三磷酸(PIP3)来拮抗其激酶的功能。PTEN 功能缺失突变能在多种不同的癌症实验模型中放大PI3K信号并促 进肿瘤发生;在人类肿瘤中，PTEN的表达常会被启动子甲基化 抑制。 Yet another example involves the mTOR kinase, a coordinator of cell growth and metabolism that lies both upstream and down- stream of the PI3K pathway. In the circuitry of some cancer cells, mTOR activation results, via negative feedback, in the inhibition of PI3K signaling. Thus, when mTOR is pharmacologically inhibited in such cancer cells (such as by the drug rapamycin), the associated loss of negative feedback results in increased activity of PI3K and its effector Akt/PKB, thereby blunting the antiproliferative effects of mTOR inhibition. It is likely that compromised negative-feedback loops in this and other signaling pathways will prove to be widespread among human cancer cells and serve as an important means by which these cells can achieve proliferative independence. Moreover, disruption of such self-attenuating signaling may contribute to the development of adaptive resistance toward drugs targeting mitogenic signaling. 另外一个例子涉及mTOR激酶，它同时存在于PI3K通路的上下 游并对细胞生长和代谢起协调作用。在某些肿瘤细胞的回路中， mTOR的活化会通过负反馈机制抑制PI3K信号。所以，在这些肿 瘤细胞中当mTOR被药物抑制时(如药物雷帕霉素)，与之相关 的负反馈调控的丧失导致PI3K及其效应分子Akt/PKB活性的增加，从而减弱了mTOR抑制剂的抗增殖效 应。在这个或其他信号通路 中被减弱的负反馈回路很可能在人类肿瘤 细胞中广泛存在，它们是肿瘤细胞取得增 殖独立性的重要手段。此外，这种自衰减 信号的破坏可能有助于癌细胞对靶向丝裂 原信号药物的抗药性的发展。 ### c. Excessive Proliferative Signaling Can Trigger Cell Senescence Early studies of oncogene action encouraged the notion that ever-increasing expression of such genes and the signals mani- fested in their protein products would result in correspondingly increased cancer cell proliferation and thus tumor growth. More recent research has undermined this notion, in that excessively elevated signaling by oncoproteins such as RAS, MYC, and RAF can provoke counteracting responses from cells, specifically induction of cell senescence and/or apoptosis. For example, cultured cells expressing high levels of the Ras oncoprotein may enter into the nonproliferative but viable state called senescence; in contrast, cells expressing lower levels of this protein may avoid senescence and proliferate. 过量的增殖信号能诱发细胞衰老 对致癌基因行为的早期研究催生出以下观 点:致癌基因表达的不断升高及其蛋白产 物所形成信号的不断增强将相应的加快癌 症细胞增殖从而促进肿瘤生长。更新的研 究结果与这一观点相悖，由致癌蛋白如 RAS,MYC和RAF形成的信号的过度增强能引起细胞的拮抗反 应，特别是会诱发细胞衰老或凋亡。例如， 表达高水平Ras肿瘤蛋白的培养细胞可能进入**衰老状态: 细胞不再增殖却依然存活**; 相反表达低水平相关蛋白的细胞能够避免衰老，维持增殖。 Cells with morphological features of senescence, including enlarged cytoplasm, the absence of proliferation markers, and expression of the senescence-induced b-galactosidase enzyme, are abundant in the tissues of mice engineered to over- express certain oncogenes and are prevalent in some cases of human melanoma. These ostensibly paradoxical responses seem to reflect intrinsic cellular defense mechanisms designed to eliminate cells experiencing excessive levels of certain types of signaling. Accordingly, the relative intensity of oncogenic signaling in cancer cells may represent compromises between maximal mitogenic stimulation and avoidance of these anti-proliferative defenses. Alternatively, some cancer cells may adapt to high levels of oncogenic signaling by disabling their senescence- or apoptosis-inducing circuitry. 具有衰老形态学特征的细胞在过表达某种致癌基因的转基因小 鼠组织中大量出现，并在某些人类黑色素瘤中普遍存在。这些衰老特征包括膨大的胞质，增殖标志物的缺失以及 衰老诱导的半乳糖苷酶的表达。这些表面上矛盾的反应似 乎显示出细胞内在的防御机制:清除过度表达某些类型信号的细 胞。因此，肿瘤细胞中致癌信号的相对强度可能代表了最强分裂刺激和回避这些抗增殖防御机制的综合反应。此外，还有一种情况，某些癌症细胞可能通过阻断细胞衰老或凋亡回路来适应高表达的致癌信号。 ## 2. Evading Growth Suppressors In addition to the hallmark capability of inducing and sustaining positively acting growth-stimulatory signals, cancer cells must also circumvent powerful programs that negatively regulate cell proliferation; many of these programs depend on the actions of tumor suppressor genes. Dozens of tumor suppressors that operate in various ways to limit cell growth and proliferation have been discovered through their characteristic inactivation in one or another form of animal or human cancer; many of these genes have been validated as bona fide tumor suppressors through gain- or loss-of-function experiments in mice. The two prototypical tumor suppressors encode the RB (retinoblas- toma-associated) and TP53 proteins; they operate as central control nodes within two key complementary cellular regulatory circuits that govern the decisions of cells to proliferate or, alter- natively, activate senescence and apoptotic programs. 回避生长抑制信号 除了诱导和维持刺激生长的信号的特征性能外，肿瘤细胞还须避 开会对细胞增殖进行负调控，其中许多程序依赖于肿瘤抑制基因 的作用。在某些动物模型或人类肿瘤中通过特征性失活发现了许 多能通过多种方式限制细胞生长和增殖的肿瘤抑制因子; 通过小鼠中的功能增强或缺失实验证实这其中的许多基因确是 肿瘤抑制因子。两个典型的肿瘤抑制因子编码RB(视网膜母细胞瘤相关 的)蛋白和TP53蛋白;他们在两个关键并互补的细胞调控环路 中作为中心控制节点起作用，它们决定细胞是进入增殖周期还是 衰老和凋亡程序。 The RB protein integrates signals from diverse extracellular and intracellular sources and, in response, decides whether or not a cell should proceed through its growth-and-division cycle. Cancer cells with defects in RB pathway function are thus missing the services of a critical gatekeeper of cell-cycle progression whose absence permits persistent cell proliferation. Whereas RB transduces growth-inhibitory signals that originate largely outside of the cell, TP53 receives inputs from stress and abnormality sensors that function within the cell’s intracellular operating systems: if the degree of damage to the genome is excessive, or if the levels of nucleotide pools, growth-promoting signals, glucose, or oxygenation are suboptimal, TP53 can call a halt to further cell-cycle progression until these conditions have been normalized. Alternatively, in the face of alarm signals indicating overwhelming or irreparable damage to such cellular subsystems, TP53 can trigger apoptosis. Notably, the various effects of activated TP53 are complex and highly context dependent, varying by cell type as well as by the severity and persistence of conditions of cell stress and genomic damage. RB蛋白能整合各种胞外和胞内来源的信号进而决定细胞是否 进入生长分裂周期。RB通路功能缺失的癌症细 胞因此失去了关键的对细胞周期进程把关的能力，导致细胞持续增殖。RB负责传递主要源自细胞外的生长抑制信号，而TP53 接收胞内运转系统中发挥功能的压力或异常传感器发出的信 号。如果基因组损伤过度，或是核苷酸含量，生长促进信号， 葡萄糖或氧合作用下降，TP53能够暂停细胞周期进程直到各种 条件恢复正常水平。还有一种情况，在面对提示细胞系统损伤 过度或无法修复的警示信号时，TP53能够诱发细胞凋亡。值得注意的是， TP53活性的不同效应是复杂并具有高度的环境依赖性，根据细胞类型和细胞压力的严重持久程度以及基因组的损伤程度而改变。 Although the two canonical suppressors of proliferation— TP53 and RB—have preeminent importance in regulating cell proliferation, various lines of evidence indicate that each operates as part of a larger network that is wired for functional redundancy. For example, chimeric嵌合体 mice populated throughout their bodies with individual cells lacking a functional Rb gene are surprisingly free of proliferative abnormalities, despite the expecation that loss of RB function would allow continuous firing of the cell division cycle in these cells and their lineal descendants; some of the resulting clusters of Rb null cells should, by all rights, progress to neoplasia. Instead, the **Rb null cells in such chimeric mice have been found to participate in relatively normal tissue morphogenesis throughout the body**; the only neoplasia observed was in the development of pituitary tumors late in life. Similarly, **TP53 null mice develop normally, show largely proper cell and tissue homeostasis, and again develop abnormalities later in life,** in the form of leukemias and sarcomas. Both examples must **reflect the operations of redundantly acting mechanisms** that serve to constrain inappropriate replication of cells lacking these key proliferation suppressors. 尽管这两种典型的增殖抑制因子–TP53和RB–在细胞增殖调控 中非常重要，多种不同证据显示他们分别是一个更大网络的一 部分。例如，令人吃惊的是，有部分Rb基因功能缺失细胞在嵌 合体小鼠并未出现增殖异常，尽管人们预期RB功能缺失会导致 细胞及其后代不断的进入细胞分裂周期;但一些Rb缺失的细胞 簇发展至肿瘤状态。相反，RB缺失细胞在这些嵌合体小鼠参与 相对正常组织的形态发生; 唯一发现的肿瘤是在生命晚期出现 了脑垂体瘤。类似的，TP53缺失小鼠 也正常发育，大部分的细胞和器官都保持着适当的内稳态，并 且也在生命晚期出现白血病和肉瘤形式的发育异常。这两个例子都反映出多重机制的 存在，它能限制细胞在失去这些关键增殖抑制因子时发生异常 复制。 ### a. Mechanisms of Contact Inhibition and Its Evasion Four decades of research have demonstrated that the cell-to- cell contacts formed by dense populations of normal cells propagated in two-dimensional culture operate to suppress further cell proliferation, yielding confluent cell monolayers. Importantly, such ‘‘contact inhibition’’ is abolished in various types of cancer cells in culture, suggesting that contact inhibition is an in vitro surrogate of a mechanism that operates in vivo to ensure normal tissue homeostasis, one that is abrogated during the course of tumorigenesis. Until recently, the mechanistic basis for this mode of growth control remained obscure. Now, however, mechanisms of contact inhibition are beginning to emerge. 过去四十年的研究表明，在二维培养条件下增殖的密集的正常细 胞形成的细胞间接触抑制了进一步的细胞增殖，从而产生单层融 合的细胞。重要的是，这样的“接触抑制”在多种培养的癌症细胞 中不存在，提示接触抑制是体内一种确保正常组织内稳态机制的 体外模式，这种机制在肿瘤发生过程中被去除。直到最近，这种 生长调控模式的机制仍不明朗。然而现在接触抑制的机制正逐步 浮出水面。 One mechanism involves the product of the NF2 gene, long implicated as a tumor suppressor because its loss triggers a form of human neurofibromatosis. Merlin, the cytoplasmic NF2 gene product, orchestrates contact inhibition via coupling cell-surface adhesion molecules (e.g., E-cadherin) to transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., the EGF receptor). In so doing, Merlin strengthens the adhesivity of cadherin-mediated cell-to-cell attachments. Additionally, by sequestering growth factor receptors, Merlin limits their ability to efficiently emit mitogenic signals. 其中的一种机制涉及NF2基因的产物，这一基因一直被认为是 一个肿瘤抑制因子，因为它的缺失会诱发人的多发性神经纤维 瘤。Merlin，NF2基因的胞质产物，能通过将细胞表面的粘附分 子(如E-钙粘蛋白)与跨膜受体酪氨酸激酶(如EGF受体)耦合 实现接触抑制。通过这种方式，Merlin增强了钙粘蛋白介导的细 胞间接触的粘附性。此外，通过限制生长因子受体，Merlin限制 了它们有效传递分裂信号的能力。 A second mechanism of contact inhibition involves the LKB1 epithelial polarity protein, which organizes epithelial structure and helps maintain tissue integrity. LKB1 can, for example, overrule the mitogenic effects of the powerful Myc oncogene when the latter is upregulated in organized, quiescent epithelial structures; in contrast, when LKB1 expression is suppressed, epithelial integrity is destabilized, and epithelial cells become susceptible to Myc-induced transformation. LKB1 has also been identified as a tumor suppressor gene that is lost in certain human malignancies, possibly reflecting its normal function as a suppressor of inappropriate proliferation. It remains to be seen how frequently these two mechanisms of contact-medi- ated growth suppression are compromised in human cancers; no doubt yet other contact-induced proliferative barriers are yet to be discovered. Clearly mechanisms like these that enable cells to construct and maintain architecturally complex tissues represent important means of suppressing and counterbalancing inappropriate proliferative signals. 接触抑制的第二种机制涉及LKB1上皮极性蛋白，这种蛋白负 责构建上皮结构并帮助维持组织的完整性。例如，当Myc癌基因 在成型的上皮结构中表达上调时，LKB1能够拮抗强大的Myc癌基 因的促分裂效果。相反，当LKB1表达被抑制时，上皮完整性变 得不稳定，且上皮细胞易感于Myc诱导的细胞转化。LKB1也已被证实是一个 肿瘤抑制基因，它在某些人类恶性肿瘤中有缺失， 这可能反映出它的正常功能是作为异常增殖的抑制因子。当然我 们依然需要了解这两种接触介导的生长抑制机制在人类癌症中发 生缺陷的频率;毫无疑问，其它的接触诱导的增殖障碍仍有待发 现。很明显，类似的保证细胞构建和维持结构复杂组织的机制是 抑制和均衡异常增值信号的重要手段。 ### b. Corruption of the TGF-b Pathway Promotes Malignancy TGF-b is best known for its antiproliferative effects, and evasion by cancer cells of these effects is now appreciated to be far more elaborate than simple shutdown of its signaling circuitry. In many late-stage tumors, TGF-b signaling is redirected away from suppressing cell proliferation and is found instead to activate a cellular program, termed the epithelial-to-mesen- chymal transition (EMT), that confers on cancer cells traits associated with high-grade malignancy, as discussed in further detail below. TGF-b以其抗增殖效应而广为人知，现今人们认为癌症细胞对 这些效应的逃避机制相当精妙，远非关闭信号环路那么简单。在许多晚期肿瘤中，TGF-b信号不再抑制细胞增殖，而是转去激活一种名为上皮间质转变(EMT)的细胞程 序，从而赋予了癌症细胞高度恶性的特性，这将在下文中详细 讨论。 ## 3. Resisting Cell Death The concept that programmed cell death by apoptosis serves as a natural barrier to cancer development has been established by compelling functional studies conducted over the last two decades. Elucidation of the signaling circuitry governing the apoptotic program has revealed how apoptosis is triggered in response to various physiologic stresses that cancer cells experience during the course of tumorigenesis or as a result of anticancer therapy. Notable among the apoptosis-inducing stresses are signaling imbalances resulting from elevated levels of oncogene signaling, as mentioned earlier, and DNA damage associated with hyperproliferation. Yet other research has revealed how apoptosis is attenuated in those tumors that succeed in progressing to states of high-grade malignancy and resistance to therapy. 抗细胞凋亡 过去二十年已经通过令人瞩目的功能研究建立了以下观点:凋亡 引起的程序性细胞死亡是肿瘤发生发展的天然屏障。对 支配凋亡程序的信号回路的阐述揭示出凋亡是如何被多种生理应 激所诱导，而癌症细胞在肿瘤发生以及抗癌治疗过程中都会经历 这些生理应激。值得注意的是，致癌基因信号水平的上升以及之 前提到的过度增殖引起的DNA损伤导致的信号失衡属于诱发凋亡 的应激反应。其他研究已经揭示凋亡在那些发展到高度恶性和治 疗无效的肿瘤中是如何被弱化的 The apoptotic machinery is composed of both upstream regu- lators and downstream effector components. The regulators, in turn, are divided into two major circuits, one receiving and processing extracellular death-inducing signals (the extrinsic apoptotic program, involving for example the Fas ligand/Fas receptor), and the other sensing and inte- grating a variety of signals of intracellular origin (the intrinsic program). Each culminates in activation of a normally latent protease (caspases 8 and 9, respectively), which proceeds to initiate a cascade of proteolysis involving effector caspases responsible for the execution phase of apoptosis, in which the cell is progressively disassembled and then consumed, both by its neighbors and by professional phagocytic cells. Currently, the intrinsic apoptotic program is more widely implicated as a barrier to cancer pathogenesis. 凋亡装置由上游调控元件和下游效应元件组成。其中调控元件分为两条主要的环路，其中一条接 收和处理胞外诱导死亡的信号(这种外在的凋亡程序包括如 Fas配体/Fas受体),另一条感知并整合一系列细胞内源信号 (内在程序)。最终每一条环路会激活一种通常沉默的蛋白酶 (分别为半胱天冬酶8和9)，进一步启动蛋白水解的级联反 应，这一反应涉及在凋亡执行阶段发挥功能的效应酶半胱天冬 酶，在这一阶段细胞会逐步解体并被周围细胞和专门的吞噬 细胞消化。当前，人们普遍认为内在的凋亡程序是癌症发生的 障碍。 The ‘‘apoptotic trigger’’ that conveys signals between the regu- lators and effectors is controlled by counterbalancing pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of regulatory proteins. The archetype, Bcl-2, along with its closest relatives (Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, A1) are inhibitors of apoptosis, acting in large part by binding to and thereby suppress- ing two proapoptotic triggering proteins (Bax and Bak); the latter are embedded in the mitochondrial outer membrane. When relieved of inhibition by their antiapoptotic relatives, Bax and Bak disrupt the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane, causing the release of proapoptotic signaling proteins, the most important of which is cytochrome c. The released cytochrome c activates, in turn, a cascade of caspases that act via their proteolytic activities to induce the multiple cellular changes associated with the apoptotic program. Bax and Bak share protein-protein interaction domains, termed BH3 motifs, with the antiapoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins that mediate their various physical interactions. The activities of a subfamily of related proteins, each of which contains a single such BH3 motif, are coupled to a variety of sensors of cellular abnormality; these ‘‘BH3-only’’ proteins act either by interfering with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins or by directly stimulating the proapoptotic members of this family. 在调控元件和效应元件之间传递信号的“凋亡触发器”由互 相制衡的**促凋亡和抗凋亡的Bcl-2调控蛋白家族成员**来控 制。其中Bcl2及其同源关系最近的几 种蛋白(Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, A1)都是凋亡抑制因子，它 们主要通过结合并抑制两种促凋亡蛋白(Bax和Bak)来发挥 作用。Bax和Bak分布在线粒体外膜中。当Bax和Bak不再受 到同源的抗凋亡蛋白抑制时，它们会破坏线粒体外膜的完整 性，引起促凋亡信号蛋白的释放，其中最重要的信号蛋白是细 胞色素C。释放出的细胞色素C接下来会激活半胱天冬酶级联 反应，通过它们的蛋白水解活性诱导与凋亡程序相关的多种细 胞改变。Bax和Bak与抗凋亡的类Bcl-2蛋白有相同的蛋白互 作结构域BH3，这一结构域介导了它们之间的多种物理相互作 用。相关蛋白亚家族(每一种蛋白都含有一个单独的BH3结构 域)的活性与多种细胞异常的感受器耦合;那些唯BH3域的蛋 白通过干扰抗凋亡的Bcl-2蛋白或是直接激活Bcl-2家族的促凋 亡成员来发挥功能 Although the cellular conditions that trigger apoptosis remain to be fully enumerated, several abnormality sensors that play key roles in tumor development have been identified. Most notable is a DNA- damage sensor that functions via the TP53 tumor suppressor; TP53 induces apoptosis by upregulat- ing expression of the Noxa and Puma BH3-only proteins, doing so in response to substantial levels of DNA breaks and other chromosomal abnormalities. Alternatively, insufficient survival factor signaling (for instance inadequate levels of interleukin-3 in lymphocytes or of insulin-like growth factor 1/2 [Igf1/2] in epithe- lial cells) can elicit apoptosis through a BH3-only protein called Bim. Yet another condition leading to cell death involves hyper- active signaling by certain oncoproteins, such as Myc, which triggers apoptosis (in part via Bim and other BH3-only proteins) unless counterbalanced by antiapoptotic factors 尽管触发凋亡的细胞条件有待充分研究，几个在肿瘤发展过程 中扮演重要角色的细胞异常感受器已被确认。其中最值得注意的是通过TP53肿瘤抑 制因子发挥功能的DNA损伤感受器; **TP53通过上调Noxa和Puma(唯BH3域)蛋白的表达诱导凋亡**， 以此来应答大量的DNA损伤和其他的染色体异常。另一种情况 是，**不足的存活因子信号**(如淋巴细胞中白介素-3或是上皮细胞 中类胰岛素生长因子1/2[Igf1/2]水平不足)会通过**唯BH3域的蛋 白Bim来诱导凋亡**。另一种导致细胞死亡的情况涉及某些癌蛋白 如Myc的超活化信号，这也会诱发细胞凋亡(部分是通过Bim和 其他唯BH3域的蛋白实现)，除非被抗凋亡因子拮抗 Tumor cells evolve a variety of strategies to limit or circumvent apoptosis. Most common is the loss of TP53 tumor suppressor function, which eliminates this critical damage sensor from the apoptosis-inducing circuitry. Alternatively, tumors may achieve similar ends by increasing expression of antiapoptotic regulators (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) or of survival signals (Igf1/2), by downregulating proapoptotic factors (Bax, Bim, Puma), or by short-circuiting the extrinsic ligand-induced death pathway. The multiplicity of apoptosis-avoiding mechanisms presumably reflects the diversity of apoptosis-inducing signals that cancer cell populations encounter during their evolution to the malignant state. The structure of the apoptotic machinery and program, and the strategies used by cancer cells to evade its actions, were widely appreciated by the beginning of the last decade. The most notable conceptual advances since then have involved other forms of cell death that broaden the scope of ‘‘pro- grammed cell death’’ as a barrier to cancer. 肿瘤细胞进化出多种策略以限制或避开凋亡。其中最普遍的情 况是TP53肿瘤抑制因子功能的缺失，从诱导凋亡的环路中移除 了关键的损伤感受器。另一种情况，肿瘤还能通过增加抗凋亡调 控因子(Bcl-2，Bcl-XL)或存活信号(Igf1/2)的表达，下调促凋 亡因子(Bax，Bim，Puma)或是阻碍外在配体诱导的死亡通路 来避开凋亡。避开凋亡的机制的多样性可能反映了癌症细胞恶化 过程中所遭遇的诱导凋亡信号的多样性。 凋亡机制的结构和调控以及癌症细胞用以避开凋亡的策略 在过去十年的得到广泛研究。最进引人注目的成果包括其它 形式的细胞死亡，这拓宽了作为肿瘤障碍的“程序性细胞死 亡”的概念。 ### a. Autophagy Mediates Both Tumor Cell Survival and Death Autophagy represents an important cell-physiologic response that, like apoptosis, normally operates at low, basal levels in cells but can be strongly induced in certain states of cellular stress, the most obvious of which is nutrient deficiency. The autophagic program enables cells to break down cellular organelles, such as ribo- somes and mitochondria, allowing the resulting catabolites to be recycled and thus used for biosynthesis and energy metabo- lism. As part of this program, intracellular vesicles termed auto- phagosomes envelope intracellular organelles and then fuse with lysosomes wherein degradation occurs. In this fashion, low- molecular-weight metabolites are generated that support survival in the stressed, nutrient-limited environments experienced by many cancer cells. 自噬介导肿瘤细胞的存活和死亡 自噬是一种类似于凋亡的重要的细胞生理反应，在正常细胞中 处于低水平的启动状态，但在一定细胞应激状态下会被强烈激 活，其中最显著的应激状态便是营养缺乏。自噬程序使细胞内核糖体和线粒体等 细胞器被降解，分解的代谢产物可以被回收利用于生物合成和 能量代谢。作为自噬程序的一部分，被称为自噬体的胞内囊泡 能包被细胞器并与溶酶体融合以启动降解。通过这一方式，许 多癌细胞产生小分子量的代谢产物以在压力且营养有限的环境 下存活。 Like apoptosis, the autophagy machinery has both regulatory and **effector components**. Among the latter are **proteins that mediate autophagosome formation and delivery to lysosomes**. Of note, recent research has revealed intersections between the regulatory circuits governing autophagy, apoptosis, and cellular homeostasis. For example, the signaling pathway involving the PI3- kinase, AKT, and mTOR kinases, which is stimulated by survival signals to block apoptosis, similarly inhibits autophagy; when survival signals are insufficient, the PI3K signaling pathway is downregulated, with the result that autophagy and/or apoptosis may be induced 与凋亡类似，自噬装置也是由调控元件和效应元件组成。其中效应元件包含介导 自噬小体形成并被传送到溶酶体的蛋白。最近的研究显示控制自 噬，凋亡和细胞内稳态的调控环路之间存在交集。例如，能被生 存信号激活的包括PI3激酶，AKT和mTOR激酶的信号通路不仅可 以阻断凋亡，也同样能够抑制自噬;当生存信号不足时，PI3K信 号通路下调，导致自噬或/和凋亡启动激活 Another interconnection between these two programs resides in the Beclin-1 protein, which has been shown by genetic studies to be necessary for induction of autophagy. Beclin-1 is a member of the BH3-only subfamily of apoptotic regulatory proteins, and its BH3 domain allows it to bind the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL proteins. Stress-sensor-coupled BH3 proteins can displace Be- clin-1 from its association with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, enabling the liberated Beclin-1 to trigger autophagy, much as they can release proapoptotic Bax and Bak to trigger apoptosis. Hence, stress-transducing BH3 proteins (e.g., Bid, Bad, Puma, et al.) can induce apoptosis and/or autophagy depending on the physiologic state of the cell. 另一个连接这两个程序的是Beclin-1蛋白，遗传研究已经证明 这一蛋白对自噬的诱导是必要的。Beclin-1是凋亡调控蛋 白BH3-only亚家族成员之一，它的BH3结构域使得它能结合到 Bcl-2/Bcl-XL蛋白上。压力感受器与BH3蛋白耦合后能取代Bcl- 2/Bcl-XL复合物中的Beclin-1，从而释放Beclin-1以引发自噬， 这跟释放促凋亡因子Bax和Bak引发凋亡的过程非常相像。因 此，压力传导的BH3蛋白(如Bid，Bad，Puma等)能根据细胞 的生理状态诱导凋亡和/或自噬。 Mice bearing inactivated alleles of the Beclin-1 gene or of certain other components of the autophagy machinery exhibit increased susceptibility to cancer. These results suggest that induction of autophagy can serve as a barrier to tumorigenesis that may operate independently of or in concert with apoptosis. Accordingly, autophagy appears to represent yet another barrier that needs to be circumvented during tumor development. 带有失活的Beclin-1等位基因或自噬装置中特定某些元件的小 鼠更容易发生肿瘤。这结果提示自噬能够单独或与凋亡协作屏障肿瘤 发生，据此，自噬可能是肿瘤发生过程中需要避开的另一障 碍 Perhaps paradoxically, nutrient starvation, radiotherapy, and certain cytotoxic drugs can induce elevated levels of autophagy that are apparently cytoprotective for cancer cells, impairing rather than accentuating the killing actions of these stress- inducing situations. Moreover, severely stressed cancer cells have been shown to shrink via autophagy to a state of reversible dormancy. This survival response may enable the persistence and eventual regrowth of some late- stage tumors following treatment with potent anticancer agents. Thus, in analogy to TGF-b signaling, which can be tumor sup- pressing at early stages of tumorigenesis and tumor promoting later on, autophagy seems to have conflicting effects on tumor cells and thus tumor progression. An important agenda for future research will involve clarifying the genetic and cell-physiologic conditions that dictate when and how autophagy enables cancer cells to survive or causes them to die. 可能自相矛盾的是，通过营养缺乏，放射治疗和特定细胞毒性 药物去杀伤癌细胞时能引起自噬水平提高，而这对癌细胞有保护 作用，能够屏障而非增强压力引起的癌细胞杀伤过程。此外，**高压下的癌细胞能够通过自噬收缩至一种可逆的休眠状态**。这种存活应答可能使经强效抗癌药物治疗的某些晚期肿 瘤得以存活并最终复发。因此，与能在肿瘤发生早期抑制肿瘤而 晚期促进肿瘤的TGF-b信号类似，**自噬看起来在肿瘤细胞和肿瘤 进程中有截然相反的效果。未来研究的一个重要方向是要阐明自噬在何时以何种方 式促进癌细胞存活或死亡的遗传和细胞生理条件。** ### b. Necrosis Has Proinflammatory and Tumor-Promoting Potential In contrast to apoptosis, in which a dying cell contracts into an almost-invisible corpse that is soon consumed by neighbors, **necrotic cells become bloated and explode, releasing their contents into the local tissue microenvironment**. Although necrosis has historically been viewed much like organismic death, as a form of system-wide exhaustion and breakdown, the conceptual landscape is changing: **cell death by necrosis is clearly under genetic control in some circumstances**, rather than being a random and undirected process. 坏死有促炎症和促肿瘤的潜能 凋亡中死亡的细胞会缩成几乎不可见的大小而很快被周围的细胞 吞噬，与之相反的是，坏死细胞会肿胀并破裂，并释放出内容物 到周围的组织微环境中。尽管坏死曾被认为是一种有机体死亡， 是以系统性衰竭和分解的形式发生，但这一概念正在发生改变: 坏死引起的细胞死亡在某些情况下明显受到遗传控制，而不是一 种随机和无序的进程。 Perhaps more important, **necrotic cell death releases proinflammatory signals into the surrounding tissue** microenvironment, in contrast to apoptosis and autophagy, which do not. As a consequence, necrotic cells can recruit inflammatory cells of the immune system, whose dedicated function is to survey the extent of tissue damage and remove associated necrotic debris. In the context of neoplasia, however, multiple lines of evidence indicate that immune inflammatory cells can be actively tumor promoting, given that such cells are capable of fostering angiogenesis, cancer cell proliferation, and invasive- ness (see below). Additionally, necrotic cells can release bio- active regulatory factors, such as IL-1a, which can directly stimulate neighboring viable cells to proliferate, with the potential, once again, to facilitate neoplastic progression. Consequently, necrotic cell death, while seemingly beneficial in counterbalancing cancer-associated hyperproliferation, may ultimately do more damage than good. Accordingly, incipient neoplasias and potentially invasive and metastatic tumors may gain an advantage by tolerating some degree of necrotic cell death, doing so in order to recruit tumor-promoting inflammatory cells that bring growth-stimulating factors to the surviving cells within these growths. 可能更为重要的是，不同于凋亡和自噬，坏死细胞死亡后会向 周围的组织微环境中释放促炎症信号。因此，坏死细胞能招募免 疫系统的炎症细胞。这些炎症细胞专门勘测组织受 损程度并移除相关的坏死碎片。然而在肿瘤中，多方面的证据这些细胞能促进血管生成、癌细胞的增殖和浸润，表明免疫炎症细 胞能积极地促进肿瘤发生(参阅下文)。此外，坏死细胞能释放 可以直接刺激邻近活细胞增殖的有生物活性的调节因子，如IL- 1a，它也具有促进肿瘤生长的潜能。因 此，细胞坏死看似能制衡癌症相关的过度增殖，但最终可能弊大 于利。所以，早期肿瘤和潜在有浸润性和转移性的肿瘤可能能通 过忍受一定程度的细胞坏死而获益，通过以上做法以招募促肿瘤 的炎症细胞，它们可以给肿瘤生长过程中存活下来的细胞带来生 长刺激因子。

###### K17 angiogenesis bFGF [paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6910/187a9360b72e488b96e4f71e0ac77ac382fc.pdf) 
Angiogenesis is crucial for solid tumor growth. By secreting angiogenic factors, tumor cells induce angiogenesis. However, targeting these angiogenic factors for cancer therapy is not al- ways successful, suggesting that other factors may be involved in tumor angiogenesis. This work shows that 25 protein spots were differentially expressed by two-dimensional gel electro- phoretic analysis when HepG2 cells induced endothelial cell differentiation to tube in vitro, and most of them were upre- gulated. Twenty-one proteins were identified with MALDI- TOF-MS, and the other four were identified by LTQ-MS/MS. Keratins were identified as one class of these upregulated proteins. Further study indicated that the expression of keratin 17 in cultured endothelial cells is likely microenvironment regulated, because its expression can be induced by HepG2 cells and bFGF as well as serum in culture media. Increased expression of keratins in endothelial cells, such as keratin 17, may contribute to the angiogenesis induced by HepG2 cells. 血管生成对于实体瘤的生长至关重要。通过分泌血管生成因子，肿瘤细胞诱导血管生成。然而，针对这些血管生成因子进行癌症治疗并不总是成功的，这表明其他因素可能参与了肿瘤血管生成。本研究表明，体外HepG2细胞诱导内皮细胞向试管分化时，二维凝胶电泳分析有25个蛋白点差异表达，且大部分蛋白点上调。 MALDI-TOF-MS 鉴定了 21 种蛋白质，LTQ-MS/MS 鉴定了其他 4 种蛋白质。角蛋白被鉴定为这些上调蛋白质中的一类。进一步的研究表明，培养的内皮细胞中角蛋白 17 的表达可能受微环境调节，因为它的表达可以被 HepG2 细胞和 bFGF 以及培养基中的血清诱导。内皮细胞角蛋白（如角蛋白 17）表达增加可能有助于 HepG2 细胞诱导的血管生成。 Hep G2 (or HepG2) is a human liver cancer cell line. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are cells derived from the endothelium of veins from the umbilical cord. They are used as a laboratory model system for the study of the function and pathology of endothelial cells (e.g., angiogenesis). 人脐静脉内皮细胞 (HUVEC) 是源自脐带静脉内皮的细胞。 它们被用作研究内皮细胞的功能和病理（例如，血管生成）的实验室模型系统。
