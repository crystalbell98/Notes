World Trade Center (WTC) first responders experienced emotionally taxing conditions and toxic exposures while working in search-and-rescue operations following the collapse of the WTC on 9/11/2001. Since those events, these responders have developed a higher prevalence of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (~23%) and are also more prone to developing cognitive impairment (CI). 

*Cognitive impairment among World Trade Center responders: Long-term implications of re-experiencing the 9/11 terrorist attacks*
In July 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiated a monitoring and treatment program for WTC responders, spanning five clinical centers. Since then, more than 33,000 responders have enrolled in the WTC Health  Program and form the WTC general responders cohort . **Stony Brook University (SBU) runs the second largest clinical center, monitoring .8000 responders residing on Long Island, NY.** SBU’s population had similar exposures to the general responder cohort and was similar in age on 9/11/2001 (38.7 in the WTC general responder cohort versus 38.4 at SBU). However, the SBU population includes relatively more law enforcement personnel and men and fewer individuals without a high-school degree. The SBU Institutional Review Board approved this study, and responders provided written informed consent; .95% of responders consented for data to be used for research purposes. 2002年7月，美国疾病控制与预防中心(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)启动了一项针对WTC反应者的监测和治疗计划，涵盖五个临床中心。自那时以来，已有3.3万多名反应者参加了世贸中心健康计划，并组成世贸中心一般反应者队列。石溪大学(SBU)运营着第二大临床中心，监测着居住在纽约长岛的8000名应答者。2001年9月11日，SBU人群暴露于一般应答者队列中相似，年龄相似(WTC组为38.7人，SBU组为38.4人)。然而，SBU人口包括相对较多的执法人员和男性，没有高中学历的人较少。SBU机构审查委员会批准了这项研究，并有回应者提供书面知情同意;.95%的应答者同意数据用于研究目的。

Trained clinicians screened responders for CI during monitoring visits at the SBU clinics starting in 2014. Of those approached, 89.8% completed the screening, 0.6% did not complete due to extenuating circumstances, 0.4% only finished part of the screening, and 8.7% refused to participate in this cognitive screening. Those who refused  testing did not differ in terms of PTSD (P 5.165), WTC exposures (P 5 .940), educational attainment (P 5 .580), or law enforcement status (P 5 .105) from those who completed testing. On average, SBU responders were aged 52.8 years when this sample was taken. A total of 818 Responders with valid diagnostic information were eligible for this study. To assess exclusion bias, 128 responders screened using a different PTSD diagnostic tool were also screened for CI. Data were linked to existing monitoring records that included PTSD and depressive symptoms measured obtained serially since baseline (Fig. 1B). Five responders who reported any head injury obtained on-site were excluded, leaving an analytic sample of 813 responders. Clinic visit date was recorded. 从2014年开始，在SBU诊所进行监测访问期间，经过培训的临床医生对反应者进行CI筛查。在这些接近者中，89.8%的人完成了筛查，0.6%的人在情有可因的情况下没有完成筛查，0.4%的人只完成了部分筛查，8.7%的人拒绝参与认知筛查。那些拒绝测试的人在PTSD (p5.165)、WTC暴露(p5.940)、教育程度(p5.580)或执法状况(p5.105)方面与那些完成测试的人没有差异。样本采集时，SBU应答者平均年龄为52.8岁。共有818名具有有效诊断信息的应答者符合本研究的条件。为了评估排除偏倚，使用不同的PTSD诊断工具筛选的128名应答者也被筛选为CI。数据与现有的监测记录相关联，包括自基线以来连续获得的创伤后应激障碍和抑郁症状(图1B)。5名现场报告头部受伤的应答者被排除在外，留下813名应答者的分析样本。记录就诊日期。

**Trained clinicians administered the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) starting February 2014**. The MoCA consists of multiple short-form neuropsychological tests that are scored in a standard way. A relatively conservative cutoff score of ,23 was used to indicate CI, and a score of,18 was used to suggest possible dementia. These cutoffs have been shown to have .95% sensitivity and specificity in community-dwelling older adults. Presence of the apolipoprotein-ε4(APOE) has been strongly associated with the risk for Alzheimer’s disease. APOE status was measured using polymerase chain reaction on blood banked in a subsample of these responders (n=593). 从2014年2月开始，经过培训的临床医生实施了蒙特利尔认知评估(MoCA)。MoCA由多种简短的神经心理学测试组成，以标准方式评分。一个相对保守的评分，23被用来表示CI，评分，18被用来表示可能的痴呆。这些临界值已被证明在社区老年人中具有0.95%的敏感性和特异性。载脂蛋白-ε4(APOE)的存在与阿尔茨海默病的风险密切相关。采用聚合酶链反应对这些应答者亚样本的血库进行APOE状态测定(n 5593)。

Predisposing characteristics were included. Education improves cognitive reserve;because .98% of responders had at least a high-school degree, education were categorized into those with some college, those completing a bachelor’s degree, versus those with less education. Occupation was dichotomized into **law enforcement (the majority at SBU) versus nontraditional responders** (e.g., construction or utility workers). Pre-WTC PTSD was assessed using the SCID. Pre-WTC history of head injury was coded as none, previous loss of consciousness, concussion, or multiple head injuries. Trauma severity was assessed at enrollment using a structured history. Two measures of exposure were included: early arrival (arrived on 9/11 and were caught in the dust cloud or saw human remains) and chronic exposure (responders who worked at least 7 days in September 2001 digging through debris). PTSD might impact cognition through impaired health and health behaviors. Five indicators were included: smoking status; hazardous drinking (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test !8); obesity, operationalized as objectively measured body mass index .30; and diagnosed hypertension or diabetes. Analyses also include WTCrelated conditions including upper respiratory disease, lower respiratory disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.  包括易感特征。教育提高认知储备，因为98%的应答者至少有高中学历，教育被分为有大学学历的人，完成学士学位的人，和教育程度较低的人。职业被分为执法部门(大多数在SBU)和非传统回应者(例如，建筑或公用事业工人)。wtc前使用SCID评估PTSD。wtc前颅脑损伤史编码为无、既往意识丧失、脑震荡或多发性颅脑损伤。在登记时采用结构化病史评估创伤严重程度。暴露的两种测量方法包括:提前到达(在9/11那天到达，被尘雾覆盖或看到了人的遗骸)和长期暴露(2001年9月在废墟中工作了至少7天的救援人员)。创伤后应激障碍可能通过健康受损和健康行为影响认知。五项指标包括:吸烟状况;危险饮酒(酒精使用障碍鉴定测试!)肥胖，操作化为客观测量的体重指数。30;诊断为高血压或糖尿病。分析还包括wtcreated条件，包括上呼吸道疾病、下呼吸道疾病和胃食管反流疾病。

*Functional Limitations among Responders to the World Trade Center Attacks 14 years After the Disaster: Implications of Chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder*
In 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established a monitoring and treatment program for September 11, 2001 rescue and recovery workers. To date, more than 33,000 responders have enrolled in the WTC general responder population (GRP; (Dasaro, et al., 2015). Stony Brook University (SBU) monitors more than 8,000 responders primarily residing on Long Island, NY, who are similar in terms of exposure, sex, and age to those enrolled in the GRP (Dasaro, et al., 2015). The responders monitored by SBU are mostly males (92.0%) who, on September 11, 2001, worked in law enforcement (71.5%) and whose average age was 38.9 years; they are now 50–60 years old. Continuing through to the present, most SBU responders (85.0%) return to either Nassau or Suffolk county clinics within 18 months of their prior visit. In 2015, the SBU program began collecting objectively assessed indicators of physical functioning. The current study focused on a consecutive sample of responders (n = 1,268) who were monitored between January and April 2016 in Suffolk County clinics, and April 2015 to April 2016 in Nassau County clinics. All responders seen during those time periods were eligible to participate. Response rates to the additional measure were very high (98.8%). Of eligible responders who were not assessed but were approached, most cited time constraints (n = 7) as a main reason to decline the assessment and others (n = 5) refused due to vertigo or recent surgery. To understand the potential for confounding and describe PTSD symptom trajectories among those participants who had functional limitations, data were linked to monitoring data collected prospectively since 2002. The study was approved by the Stony Brook University Ethics Review Board; responders provided informed, written consent. 2002年，美国疾病控制与预防中心(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)为2001年9月11日的救援和恢复工作人员建立了一个监测和治疗计划。迄今为止，已有33,000多名反应者加入世贸中心一般反应者群体(GRP;(Dasaro等，2015)。石溪大学(SBU)监测了8000多名主要居住在纽约长岛的应答者，他们在接触、性别和年龄方面与GRP登记的人相似(Dasaro, et al.， 2015)。SBU监测的应答者多为男性(92.0%)，2001年9月11日在执法部门工作(71.5%)，平均年龄为38.9岁;他们现在已经五六十岁了。继续到现在，大多数SBU反应者(85.0%)在他们之前的访问18个月内返回拿骚或萨福克县诊所。2015年，SBU项目开始收集客观评估的身体机能指标。目前的研究集中于2016年1月至4月在萨福克县诊所监测的连续反应者样本(n = 1268)，以及2015年4月至2016年4月在拿骚县诊所监测的反应者样本。所有在那段时间内看到的反应者都有资格参与。对附加措施的回应率非常高(98.8%)。在未被评估但被接触的合格应答者中，时间限制(n = 7)是拒绝评估的主要原因，其他(n = 5)因眩晕或近期手术而拒绝评估。为了理解混淆的可能性，并描述那些有功能限制的参与者的PTSD症状轨迹，数据与2002年以来收集的前瞻性监测数据相关联。这项研究得到了石溪大学伦理审查委员会(Stony Brook University Ethics Review Board)的批准;响应者提供知情的书面同意。

When compared with the SBU population of responders who were eligible for research but did not complete the functional assessment, those who completed the functional assessment were 0.85 years younger than those who did complete the assessment (p < .001) and were  less likely to be women (p = .004), but had similar occupations on September 11, 2001 (p = . 115), similar levels of current PTSD (p = .521), and similar baseline PCL scores (p = .455). Longitudinal data from the monitoring study revealed that 1,268 responders in the analytic sample had previously provided 10,904.5 person-years of information collected during 7,013 visits occurring between 2002 and 2015. Few existing publicly available studies include normative data comparable to the WTC sample. Studies that have measured functional limitations have done so among individuals aged 65 years and older, and many samples are not large enough to match by occupation. For our comparison, we therefore used data from participants aged 65 to 69 years from the baseline wave of the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) (2011). The NHATS is a nationally representative study of 8,245 older American adults, 1,419 of whom were aged 65 to 69 years at baseline. To further ensure comparability, we excluded respondents with less than a high school diploma (n = 289), and those whose longest lifetime occupations were not common for WTC responders (e.g. protective services, maintenance, construction, utilities, trades/repair, transportation, community and social services, or military occupations; n = 938). Of those who remained, 170 respondents had completed the physical performance battery. Analyses were weighted to the U.S. population to account for sample selection. 当与符合研究条件但未完成功能评估的SBU人群相比，那些完成功能评估的人比完成评估的人年轻0.85岁(p < .001)，且不太可能是女性(p = .004)，但在2001年9月11日有类似的职业(p = .004)。目前的PTSD水平相似(p = .521)，基线PCL得分相似(p = .455)。监测研究的纵向数据显示，分析样本中的1268名应答者此前提供了2002年至2015年期间7013次访问期间收集的10904.5人年的信息。现有的公开研究很少包括与世贸中心样本相比较的标准数据。那些测量功能限制的研究是在65岁及以上的人群中进行的，而且很多样本不够大，无法按职业匹配。因此，为了进行比较，我们使用了来自国家健康和老龄化趋势研究(NHATS, 2011)基线波的65 - 69岁参与者的数据。NHATS是一项具有全国代表性的研究，研究对象为8245名美国老年人，其中1419人的基线年龄在65至69岁之间。为了进一步确保可比性，我们排除了高中以下学历的受访者(n = 289)，以及那些最长职业生涯的人不常见的世贸中心应对者(如保护性服务，维护，建筑，公用事业，贸易/修理，交通，社区和社会服务，或军事职业;N = 938)。在那些留下来的受访者中，170人完成了体能测试。分析对美国人口进行了加权，以考虑样本选择。

Exposure severity was assessed during the first monitoring visit using a structured history. Many responders experienced overlapping exposures. First, “early arrival” indicated whether responders arrived at the WTC site on September 11, 2001 and were caught in the dust cloud that was present that day. Second, “chronic exposure” identified responders who worked at the WTC site at least seven days in September 2001, digging through the debris looking for survivors and human remains. Third, we examined  whether individuals reported having been exposed, during WTC-related work activities, to “ergonomic exposures” (e.g., repetitive motions, forceful exertions, awkward or static postures, manual or heavy lifting, vibrations, or impact tool usage). Finally, an overall exposure severity index, commonly used in WTC-related pulmonary research, was also used (Wisnivesky, et al., 2011). 在第一次监测访视期间，使用结构化病史评估暴露严重程度。许多应答者经历了重叠暴露。首先，“早到”表明急救人员是否在2001年9月11日到达世贸中心现场，并被当天的尘雾所困。第二，“长期暴露”确认了2001年9月在世贸中心工作了至少7天的救援人员，他们在废墟中挖掘寻找幸存者和人体残骸。第三，我们检查了在wtc相关的工作活动中，个体是否报告暴露于“人体工程学暴露”(例如，重复的运动，用力的用力，笨拙或静态的姿势，手动或沉重的举起，振动，或使用冲击工具)。最后，还使用了wtc相关肺研究中常用的总体暴露严重程度指数(Wisnivesky, et al.， 2011)。

Predisposing characteristics—These included: (1) education: because 95.8% of responders in the SBU population had at least a high school degree, education was categorized into “some college or less” versus “bachelor’s degree or more”, with less education serving as the reference category; (2) occupation: this was dichotomized into law enforcement (which comprised a large proportion of the SBU population), and nontraditional responders (a group made up largely of construction and utility workers). 倾向特征-这些包括:(1)教育:因为在SBU人口中95.8%的应答者至少有高中学历，教育被归类为“一些大学或更少”与“学士或更多”，较低学历作为参考类别;(2)职业:这被分为执法部门(组成了很大比例的SBU人口)和非传统响应者(主要由建筑和公用事业工人组成的群体)。

Health and behavioral mediators—These were assessed using five indicators: current or past smoking; hazardous drinking ( 8 on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test; (Bohn, Babor, & Kranzler, 1995); obesity, operationalized as body mass index > 30 kg/m2 based on nurse-measured height and weight; and clinician-reported diagnoses of hypertension and diabetes. 健康和行为调节因素——通过五个指标进行评估:当前或过去吸烟;危险饮酒(酒精使用障碍鉴定测验8分;(Bohn, Babor， & Kranzler, 1995);肥胖，操作为体重指数> 30 kg/m2，根据护士测量的身高和体重;临床医生报告高血压和糖尿病的诊断。

*Proton pump inhibitors and the risk of severe cognitive impairment: The role of posttraumatic stress disorder* 
When the WTC towers collapsed, the men and women who helped in rescue and recovery operations experienced an array of psychological exposures and ingested a huge amount of toxic dust. Starting in 2002, the health of responders has been monitored by a network of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded WTC-Health Programs. Extensive outreach efforts and cohort recruitment protocols have been described elsewhere. Once enrolled, responders receive comprehensive annual medical and psychiatric examinations and are entitled to free treatment for WTC-related conditions. Cognitive impairment screens were added to the monitoring examination at the Stony Brook University clinics starting in 2014.  The source population for this study included 5658 responders who had ever had a monitoring visit and had valid exposure information. In total, 34.7%of the source population (n 5 2121) were dispensed PPIs between the years 2011– 2016. Of these, 3855 responders were successfully screened for cognitive assessments between 2014–July 2016 (response rate 5 93.8% of those approached for testing). Among responders who completed the screen, n 5 3779 had complete data on the key study variables (GERD, PTSD, major depressive disorder, and WTC exposure severity). The analytic sample did not differ from those who were cognitively assessed in terms of PTSD, MDD, and WTC exposure but were more likely to have GERD and to have been dispensed PPIs (Supplementary Table 1). The sample included police andnontraditional responders (e.g., constructionworkers, utility workers). The average age on 9/11/2001 was 39 years. Most were male and employed in 2001.  The Stony Brook University Review Board approved this study, and all responders provided informed written consent for their clinical data to be used for research purposes. 世贸中心大楼倒塌时，参与救援和恢复工作的人们经历了一系列心理暴露，并摄入了大量有毒粉尘。从2002年开始，由疾病控制和预防中心资助的wtc -健康项目网络一直在监测应急人员的健康状况。广泛的外联工作和队列招募协议已在其他地方描述。一旦登记，反应者每年接受全面的医疗和精神检查，并有权免费治疗与世贸组织有关的疾病。自2014年起，石溪大学(Stony Brook University)诊所将认知障碍筛查添加到监测检查中。本研究的来源人群包括5658名曾接受过监测访问并拥有有效暴露信息的应答者。2011 - 2016年，34.7%的源人群(5 2121人)使用了PPIs。其中，在2014 - 2016年7月期间，3855名应答者被成功筛选进行认知评估(应答率为5 93.8%)。在完成筛查的应答者中，有5 3779人拥有关键研究变量(GERD、PTSD、重度抑郁症和WTC暴露严重程度)的完整数据。分析样本与那些在创伤后应激障碍、重度抑郁症和WTC暴露方面进行认知评估的人没有差异，但更有可能患有GERD和服用PPIs(补充表1)。样本包括警察和非传统应急人员(如建筑工人、公用设施工人)。2001年9月11日的平均年龄是39岁。其中大多数是男性，在2001年就业。石溪大学审查委员会批准了这项研究，所有回应者都提供了知情书面同意，他们的临床数据用于研究目的。

*Traumatic exposures, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive functioning in World Trade Center responders* 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created a monitoring and treatment program for WTC responders with centers in areas where responders reside. More than 33,000 responders have enrolled in the WTC Health Program, forming what is known as the general responder’s cohort (GRC). Stony Brook University (SBU) operates the second largest program and regularly monitors .8000 WTC responders residing on Long Island, NY. Monitoring appointments occur regularly every 12–18 months; a team of outreach and retention  specialists is constantly engaged in ensuring that care is available and routine for all members of the cohort. Compared to the GRC, SBU responders had similar exposures and were similar in age on 9/11/2001 (GRC 5 38.7, SBU 5 38.4), but the SBU population includes more law enforcement personnel, more men, and fewer responders without a high school degree. For the present study, a prospective cohort of WTC responders completed a computer-assisted neuropsychological battery starting November 2015–June 2016. Trained research staff administered the cognitive tasks in a standard way in a quiet examination room at the clinic after monitoring visits were completed. Reasons for study refusal were recorded for all eligible responders. Responders who assented to the study were asked to first complete a short training in each task. 美国疾病控制与预防中心(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)为世贸中心(WTC)的应急人员建立了一个监测和治疗项目，在应急人员居住的地区设立了中心。超过3.3万名应答者参加了WTC健康计划，形成了所谓的一般应答者队列(GRC)。石溪大学(SBU)运营着第二大项目，定期监测居住在纽约长岛的8000名世贸中心应急人员。每12-18个月定期进行一次监测预约;一个由外展和保留专家组成的团队不断参与，确保队列中所有成员都能获得常规护理。与GRC相比，SBU反应者在2001年9月11日有相似的暴露和相似的年龄(GRC 5 38.7, SBU 5 38.4)，但SBU人口包括更多的执法人员，更多的男性，没有高中学历的反应者更少。在本研究中，一组WTC反应者从2015年11月至2016年6月完成了计算机辅助神经心理测试。经过培训的研究人员在完成监测访问后，在诊所安静的检查室以标准的方式管理认知任务。对所有符合条件的应答者记录拒绝研究的原因。同意这项研究的应答者被要求在每个任务中首先完成一个短期训练。

## WTC occupation paper
Almost one-half (47%) of the WTC responders in this cohort were employed in the protective services (SOC 33) before 9/11 (Tables I and III). Within the protective services category, the majority (92%) of these workers were law enforcement officers with the largest groups being union members of the NYC Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association (PBA), the NYC Detectives’ Endowment Association (DEA), and the NYC Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA). There were 280 firefighters from fire departments other than FDNY, which has its own WTC monitoring program. In addition, there were retired firefighters who may be included under the category of ‘‘Other occupations.’’ The remaining one-half of the WTC responders were from pre-9/11 occupations not typically  identified as emergency responders (Table I). Among these, construction workers (SOC 47) were the most common group (23% of responders). Within this SOC the predominant subgroup was construction trades workers (SOC 47-2000, 13% of all responders). Also within SOC 47 there was a subgroup that was disproportionately Hispanic (47% vs. 18% for trades workers) comprised of ‘‘other construction and related workers’’ (SOC 47-4000, 9% of all WTC responders). This subgroup contained the asbestos/hazardous materials removal workers, as well as fence erectors, elevator repairers, building inspectors and other jobs (Supplementary Table I). 近一半(47%)的WTC应急人员在9/11之前受雇于保护服务(SOC 33)(表一和表三)。在保护服务类别中，大多数(92%)的这些工人是执法人员，最大的群体是纽约市巡警慈善协会(PBA)、纽约市侦探捐赠协会(DEA)和纽约市中士慈善协会(SBA)的工会成员。除了纽约消防局，还有280名消防队员，纽约消防局有自己的WTC监控程序。此外，还有退休的消防队员，他们可能被列入“其他职业”的类别。“其余一半的WTC反应者来自9/11之前的职业，通常不被确定为紧急反应者(表一)。其中，建筑工人(SOC 47)是最常见的群体(23%的反应者)。在这个SOC中，主要的亚组是建筑行业工人(SOC 47-2000，所有应答者的13%)。在SOC 47中也有一个亚组，西班牙裔不成比例(47% vs. 18%的行业工人)由“其他建筑和相关工人”组成(SOC 47-4000，所有WTC应答者的9%)。这一分组包括石棉/危险材料清除工人以及栅栏安装工、电梯修理工、建筑检查员和其他工作(补充表一)。

The next most common SOC codes comprised in total less than 20% of the responders (Table I and Supplementary Table I). They were SOC 49 (7% of responders), which included a diverse group of installation, maintenance, and repair occupations. Although the majority of these workers were involved in telecommunications or electrical repair work, 10% of the workers in this SOC were listed as vehicle mechanics (SOC 49-3000). We have titled this group (SOC 49) electrical, telecommunications & other installation & repair. In the transportation and material moving group, SOC 53 (4% of total cohort), onehalf of the workers (51%) were truck, ambulance or bus  drivers, and 35% material moving workers, which includes sanitation and other material moving workers. The business, engineering and administrative group (6% of total cohort) included the SOC categories 11 (management occupations), 13 (business and financial,) and 17 (architecture and engineering). The ‘‘other occupations’’ group (combined <3% of the workforce) included a variety of SOCs. Those with over 45 people included the health professions (SOC 21, 29, and 39), building and grounds maintenance workers (SOC 37), hourly workers from retail, factory or food preparation occupations (SOC 35, 41, and 51), broadcast/media personnel and artists (SOC 27), and miscellaneous occupations such as teacher/librarian (SOC 25), computer programmers/analysts (SOC 15), psychologist, sociologist, and environmental health scientists (SOC 19) as well as retired/unemployed and other unclassified individuals. Within ‘‘other occupations’’ some of the subgroups had high percentages of Hispanic workers including the building and grounds maintenance workers (75%), the retired and unemployed responders (45%) and the hourly workers from retail, factory or food preparation occupations (37%). 下一个最常见的SOC代码总共包含不到20%的应答者(表一和补充表一)。它们是SOC 49(应答者的7%)，包括各种各样的安装、维护和修理职业。虽然这些工人大部分参与电信或电气维修工作，但在这个SOC中，10%的工人被列为车辆机械师(SOC 49-3000)。我们将这一组(SOC 49)命名为电气、电信和其他安装和维修。在运输和物资搬运组，SOC 53(占整个队列的4%)，一半的工人(51%)是卡车、救护车或公共汽车司机，35%的物资搬运工人，包括卫生和其他物资搬运工人。商业、工程和行政组(占全体队列的6%)包括SOC类别11(管理职业)、13(商业和金融)和17(建筑和工程)。“其他职业”组(合计小于3%的劳动力)包括各种不同的soc。超过45人的职业包括卫生专业(SOC 21、29和39)，建筑和地面维护工人(SOC 37)，零售、工厂或食品准备行业的小时工(SOC 35、41和51)，广播/媒体人员和艺术家(SOC 27)，以及杂项职业，如教师/图书管理员(SOC 25)，计算机程序员/分析师(SOC 15)，心理学家、社会学家、和环境健康科学家(SOC 19)以及退休/失业和其他未分类的个人。在“其他职业”的一些亚群体中，西班牙裔工人的比例很高，包括建筑和地面维护工人(75%)，退休和失业应答者(45%)和零售、工厂或食品准备职业的小时工(37%)。

Volunteers, not including those who were both employed on site and volunteered, comprised approximately 14% of the WTC responders. The most common pre-9/11 occupations for volunteers included construction (27%) followed by law enforcement (21%), business, engineering and administration (12%), retired and unemployed workers (7%), and health care workers (8%). It should be noted that many responders both worked for pay and also volunteered at the WTC, especially during September when search, rescue and recovery work was ongoing. Public sector workers made up 61% of the total workforce. These responders can be further subdivided with the majority (45.5% of the total workforce) in the ‘‘protective services’’ group employed in the public sector, mostly the NYPD. The remaining public sector responders (15.5% of the total workforce) were comprised of workers from many NYC agencies, some construction trades’ civil service divisions, and other government workers. Overall, the number of workers at the WTC decreased with time (Table III). However, the percentage of the overall workforce comprised of each occupational group remained relatively stable over time. 志愿者，不包括那些在现场工作和自愿的人，约占世贸中心反应者的14%。911之前，志愿者最常见的职业包括建筑(27%)，其次是执法(21%)、商业、工程和管理(12%)、退休和失业工人(7%)和卫生保健工作者(8%)。值得注意的是，许多救援人员在世贸中心工作是有偿的，也是自愿的，特别是在9月的搜索、救援和恢复工作仍在进行的时候。公共部门工作人员占劳动力总数的61%。这些反应者可以进一步细分为受雇于公共部门(主要是纽约警察局)的“保护服务”群体中的大多数(占总劳动力的45.5%)。其余的公共部门应急人员(占总劳动力的15.5%)包括来自纽约市许多机构、一些建筑行业的公务员部门和其他政府工作人员。总的来说，世贸中心的工人人数随着时间的推移而减少(表三)。但是，由每一职业组组成的总劳动力百分比在一段时间内保持相对稳定。

The total number of responders in our program went from a peak of 17,651 in September, 2001 to 8,430 in the period ending in June, 2002 (Table III). Approximately one-half (44%) of WTC responders began their response work on 9/11. Of these, 46% reported being ‘‘directly in the dust cloud (blackout) created from the WTC collapse.’’ Another 35% of the cohort arrived at the site between 9/ 12 and 9/14, 2001. Overall, 93% of responders began to work at the site sometime during the month of September, 2001 (Table III). The majority of responders arriving on 9/11 were in the protective services (65% n ¼ 5,441), followed by workers in construction occupations (12% n ¼ 979), ‘‘other occupations’’ (23%; including business, engineering and administrative professionals (n ¼ 456), electrical, telecommunications & other installation & repair workers (n ¼ 400), and transportation & material movers (n ¼ 206)). Among the protective service workers who arrived on September 11th, 29% were present ‘‘directly in the dust cloud (blackout) created from the WTC collapse.’’ Among business, engineering and administrative professionals 19% were present at the collapse, while for all other occupational groups 9–16% were present at the collapse. Protective service continued to be the most common occupation among responders arriving during 9/12 and 9/14, 2001. From September 15–30, 2001 new responders continued to arrive but at a slower rate. 我们项目中的救援人员总数从2001年9月的17651人上升到2002年6月的8430人(表三)。大约有一半(44%)的救援人员在9/11那天就开始了他们的救援工作。其中，46%的人报告说他们“直接处于世贸中心倒塌造成的尘雾(停电)中”。另外35%的人是在2001年9月12日到9月14日之间到达的。总体而言，93%的responders在2001年9月的某个时候开始在现场工作(表三)。9/11到达的大多数responders是在保护部门(65% n¼5441)，其次是建筑行业(12% n¼979)，“其他行业”(23%;包括商业、工程和行政管理专业人员(n = 456)、电气、电信和其他安装和维修工人(n = 400)以及运输和材料搬运工(n = 206)。在9月11日抵达的安保人员中，29%的人“直接身处世贸中心倒塌造成的尘雾(停电)中”。在商业、工程和行政专业人士中，有19%的人出现在事故现场，而在所有其他职业群体中，有9-16%的人出现在事故现场。在2001年9月12日和9月14日期间，防护服务仍然是到达现场的急救人员中最常见的职业。从2001年9月15日至30日，新的救援人员继续抵达，但速度变慢了。

All occupational groups reported a wide range of days worked (median 56, mean 79, range 1–293 days). Onehalf (51%) of responders worked <60 days, while only 23% worked >130 days. Responders in the ‘‘other occupations’’ subgroup of buildings and grounds cleaning and maintenance (SOC 37) as well as the electrical, telecommunications & other installation & repair group (SOC 49) had the largest average time on the site (108 and 102 days, respectively), as the utilities infrastructure recovery and repair continued well after the work on the ‘‘pile’’ ended. Conversely, those in protective services and the overall ‘‘other occupations’’ group had the lowest average number of days (72 days) working at the site (Table III). Many responders worked night shifts as well as day shifts. Data on work shift were available only for the October 2001–June 2002 period. Forty eight percent of responders who worked at any time between October 2001–June 2002 reported working both day and night shifts, with about one-half of protective services workers (56%) reporting work during both shifts (not necessarily back to back). From October through June, 3–5% of the responders reported always or mainly sleeping onsite. The average hours per day worked varied somewhat by time period: September mean 12.3 hr/day (SD 3.3); October mean 11.5 hr/day (SD 2.8); November-December mean 11.1 hr/day (SD 2.6); January–June mean 10.5 hr/ day (SD 2.6). 所有职业组报告的工作天数范围都很广(中位数56天，平均79天，范围1-293天)。半数(51%)应答者工作时间<60天，而只有23%应答者工作130天。建筑和地面清洁和维护(SOC 37)以及电气、电信和其他安装和维修组(SOC 49)中的“其他职业”应答者在现场的平均时间最长(分别为108天和102天)，因为在“桩”工作结束后，公用事业基础设施的恢复和维修仍在继续。相反，那些在保护服务和整体的“其他职业”组在现场工作的平均天数(72天)最低(表三)。许多应答者工作在夜班和白班。现时只提供2001年10月至2002年6月期间的轮班数据。在2001年10月至2002年6月期间，在任何时间工作的应答者中，有48%的人报告同时工作白班和夜班，约有一半的防护服务人员(56%)报告在两个班次中工作(不一定是背靠背)。从10月到6月，有3-5%的应答者表示经常或主要在现场睡觉。平均每天工作时间因时间段而有所不同:9月平均每天12.3小时(SD 3.3);十月平均11.5小时/天(SD 2.8);11 - 12月平均每天11.1小时(SD 2.6);1 - 6月平均10.5小时/天(SD 2.6)。

Our study showed that the response to the WTC disaster included workers from diverse occupations and backgrounds. Almost one-half of the responders (excluding FDNY fire fighters/EMT’s) belonged to the protective services, primarily police officers and mostly NYPD. However, we found that a large number of workers (>50% of the cohort) were not part of the typical emergency/first responder groups. For example, 22% of the responders were from construction occupations. Due to the major damage to the utility infrastructure in lower Manhattan, a substantial number of workers came from electrical, telecommunications & other installation & repair occupations. Public sector workers comprised more than one-half (61%)of the total responder population and public sector workers were included in all occupational categories. For example, among the construction occupations there were transit and city and municipal workers who are in the construction trades. There were also many other smaller groups of non-traditional emergency responders such as business managers and administrators, clerks, engineers, broadcast and media personnel, social workers, and computer specialists. Although traditional responders receive prior training and have experience in emergency response, other groups were considerably less well prepared for disaster response. Our findings point to the need for prior emergency response planning and training of non-traditional responders who will always be part of a disaster response, such as the groups listed above. Early on-site health and safety training and the provision of appropriate personal protective equipment for these non-traditional responders can minimize potential toxic exposures and decrease the risk of injury during recovery activities. 我们的研究表明，对世贸中心灾难的反应包括来自不同职业和背景的工人。几乎一半的响应者(不包括纽约消防局消防队员/急救人员)属于保护服务部门，主要是警察和主要是纽约市警察局。然而，我们发现大量工作人员(50%的队列人员)不属于典型的应急/第一反应人员群体。例如，22%的应答者来自建筑行业。由于曼哈顿下城公用事业基础设施遭到严重破坏，大量工人来自电力、电信和其他安装维修行业。公共部门工作人员占答复者总人口的一半以上(61%)，公共部门工作人员包括所有职业类别。例如，在建筑行业中有运输和城市和市政工人，他们在建筑行业。还有许多其他非传统应急反应人员的小群体，如业务经理和行政人员、职员、工程师、广播和媒体人员、社会工作者和计算机专家。虽然传统的应急人员事先接受过应急培训并有应急经验，但其他群体对灾害应急的准备要差得多。我们的调查结果表明，需要事先制定应急计划，并培训始终是救灾工作一部分的非传统应急人员，例如上面列出的群体。及早进行现场健康和安全培训，并为这些非传统应急人员提供适当的个人防护装备，可最大限度地减少潜在的有毒接触，并减少在恢复活动中受伤的风险。

Assessing the type and extent of exposures is extremely important for understanding potential health consequences among WTC responders. The findings reported herein are a platform for the development of a matrix to characterize exposures among WTC responders. Several previous studies have found that the time of first arrival at the WTC, a crude measure of exposure to the dust cloud from the collapse, is one variable that can provide a temporal differentiation in risk [Banauch et al., 2006; Herbert et al., 2006; Wheeler et al., 2007; Skloot et al., 2009]. In  this study, we found that a large number of responders (44%) began work on 9/11, with 46% of them present directly in the cloud of dust from the WTC collapse. Since in this cohort, those who arrived on September 11 were predominately from the protective services group (65%) it is likely that many of them arrived at the site as part of the initial response to the crash of the planes. However, among the remainder of the occupational groups who arrived on 9/11, large proportions also reported being present during the collapse. It should be noted that workers were mobilized from the entire NY/NJ metropolitan area throughout the day after the initial crash and that there were three separate building collapses at different times on that day (the South Tower at 9:59 AM, the North Tower at 10:28 AM and WTC 7 at 5:20 PM). 评估接触的类型和程度对于了解WTC反应者的潜在健康后果极其重要。本文报道的研究结果为WTC反应者暴露特征矩阵的开发提供了一个平台。先前的几项研究发现，第一次到达世贸中心的时间是一个可以提供风险时间差异的变量(Banauch et al.， 2006;Herbert等人，2006;惠勒等人，2007;Skloot等人，2009。在这项研究中，我们发现大量的应急人员(44%)在9/11事件中开始工作，其中46%的人直接出现在世贸中心倒塌产生的尘雾中。由于在这组人中，9月11日抵达的人主要来自保护服务小组(65%)，因此他们中的许多人抵达现场很可能是对飞机坠毁的初步反应的一部分。然而，在9/11那天抵达的其他职业群体中，也有很大一部分人报告说在崩溃期间也在场。值得注意的是，在最初的事故发生后，整个纽约/新泽西大都会地区的工作人员动员了一整天，那天有三幢独立的大楼在不同时间倒塌(南塔在上午9点59分，北塔在上午10点28分，世贸中心7号楼在下午5点20分)。

Most responders (93%) began work in September. This may explain the consistency in the average number of days worked across all occupational groups (72–102 days). In addition, workers in several occupational groups (e.g., construction, electrical, telecommunications and other installation, and repair workers among others) continued work after the time period covered by the exposure assessment questionnaire (end date June 30, 2002). Due to the added stresses of shift work, it is of particular interest that 48% of the WTC responders reported working both day and night shift even in the period after September, and 3–5% of the responders reporting always or mainly sleeping onsite. By late September, a veritable tent city had grown up adjacent to the pile, with many responder organizations having their own tents [Smith, 2002]. The location and type of the responders’ work are considered an important determinant of potential exposures. Our findings show that the most common work location was ‘‘adjacent to the pile’’ followed by on the ‘‘pile or pit,’’ although this varied for different occupations. Some of the work also occurred in enclosed spaces within buildings and the relationship of indoor exposures compared to outdoor exposures has yet to be assessed. In the future, these factors (timeline, location, indoor vs. outdoor, along with activity) should be combined to create an exposure assessment model that can be used in evaluating health risks among WTC responders. 大多数应答者(93%)于9月开始工作。这可能解释了所有职业群体的平均工作天数的一致性(72-102天)。此外，若干职业群体的工人(例如，建筑、电气、电信和其他安装和维修工人等)在暴露评估问卷所涵盖的时间段(2002年6月30日结束)之后继续工作。由于轮班工作带来的额外压力，特别值得关注的是，48%的WTC应答者报告说，即使在9月之后，他们也在白班和夜班工作，3-5%的应答者报告说，他们总是或主要在现场睡觉。到9月下旬，一个名副其实的帐篷城已经在堆旁边成长起来，许多响应组织有他们自己的帐篷[Smith, 2002]。应答者工作的地点和类型被认为是潜在暴露的一个重要决定因素。我们的发现表明，最常见的工作地点是“邻近的桩”，其次是“桩或坑”，尽管这因职业的不同而不同。一些工作也发生在建筑物内的封闭空间，室内暴露与室外暴露之间的关系还有待评估。未来，这些因素(时间、地点、室内与室外，以及活动)应结合起来，建立一个暴露评估模型，可用于评估WTC反应者的健康风险。

In examining the geographic and temporal taxonomy of activities, it becomes apparent that in a disaster of the magnitude of the WTC collapse, the crisis response requires most responders to engage initially in search, rescue and recovery, regardless of their pre-disaster occupation. In fact, for most of the occupational groups included in this study, search, rescue, and recovery were the most commonly reported activities during the month of September, 2001. After this initial period, most responders were engaged in activities related to their original, pre-9/11, occupations. Nevertheless, building and grounds cleaning  was a commonly reported activity in most occupational groups, due to the wide-spread contamination of dust and debris from the collapse. Because protective services was the most common occupation in this cohort, security work was a very commonly reported activity. The WTC site was considered a crime scene with only authorized personnel allowed access. In addition, this urban disaster was located in a major financial center that also included a dense concentration of residential and commercial properties that remained under heightened security due to a threat of additional terrorist action. 在考察活动的地理和时间分类时，很明显，在世贸中心倒塌这样规模的灾难中，危机响应要求大多数响应者最初参与搜索、救援和恢复，而不管他们在灾前的职业。事实上，对于本研究中包括的大多数职业群体来说，搜索、救援和恢复是2001年9月最常被报道的活动。在最初的阶段之后，大多数响应者都从事与他们最初的、9/11之前的职业有关的活动。然而，在大多数职业群体中，建筑和地面清洁是一项普遍报告的活动，因为倒塌造成的灰尘和碎片广泛污染。由于保护性服务是这个队列中最常见的职业，保安工作是一个非常普遍的报道活动。世贸中心被认为是犯罪现场，只有经过授权的人员才能进入。此外，这场城市灾难发生在一个主要的金融中心，也包括密集的住宅和商业物业，由于恐怖主义行动的威胁，这些物业仍处于高度安全状态。

This study provides a comprehensive description of the different groups, work periods, and type of activities performed by a large cohort of responders enrolled in the WTC MMTP. However, NYC firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and short term workers were not eligible for this program and thus, are not represented in this report. Moreover, not all potentially eligible WTC responders have enrolled in the MMTP. Thus, the distribution of occupations may reflect in part the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the WTC MMTP. Data for our study were obtained from answers to a standardized questionnaire routinely administered as part of the initial visit to the WTC MMTP. Although the exposure assessment survey includes detailed questions about activities, dates, times, and locations of work, the information is based on selfreports and thus, potentially subject to recall and other types of biases. Another limitation in our data is related to the use of the SOC groups to describe a responder’s pre-9/11 occupation. Unfortunately, the SOC groups often combine relatively different occupations within a single category. However, this is a validated system to classify workers and is one of the most commonly employed coding systems in the literature as well as in the National Health Interview Survey. 本研究提供了一个广泛的描述，不同的组，工作时间，和活动的类型进行了大队列应答者登记在WTC MMTP。然而，纽约市的消防队员、紧急医疗技术人员和短期工人不符合该计划的资格，因此，在本报告中没有出现。此外，并不是所有潜在的合格的WTC反应者都参加了MMTP。因此，职业的分布可能部分地反映了WTC MMTP的纳入和排除标准。我们研究的数据来自于一份标准化问卷的答案，该问卷作为WTC MMTP初始访问的一部分进行常规管理。尽管暴露评估调查包括关于活动、日期、时间和工作地点的详细问题，但这些信息是基于自我报告的，因此可能会被回忆和其他类型的偏见。我们数据的另一个限制是使用SOC组来描述911前的占领。不幸的是，SOC群体经常将相对不同的职业组合在一个类别中。然而，这是一个有效的分类工人的系统，是文献和国家健康访谈调查中最常用的编码系统之一。

The structure of the MMTP questionnaire restricted some analyses. For example, activity information was collected for four time periods and the location of the majority of the responders work during each time period was assessed separately. As a consequence, we are unable to make a direct link between each task and a specific location. Instead we have assumed that the activities reported during a time period occurred at the location reported by the responder as the site they spend the majority of their shift during the time period. Similarly, there was no information collected about activities on a daily basis following the collapse of the twin towers. This information would have allowed us to describe in further detail how activity patterns changed as the WTC site transitioned from crisis response to the subsequent recovery phase. Additionally, the WTC exposure questionnaire is limited to activities performed through June 30, 2002. However, work in some occupations, such as telecommunications, construction  and at some sites, such as the Fresh Kills landfill, continued well beyond this date. MMTP问卷的结构限制了一些分析。例如，在四个时间段内收集活动信息，并分别评估每个时间段内大多数应答者工作的位置。因此，我们无法在每个任务和特定地点之间建立直接联系。相反，我们假设在一段时间内报告的活动发生在响应者报告的地点，作为他们在一段时间内的大部分转移的地点。同样，在双子塔倒塌后，也没有收集到有关日常活动的信息。这些信息将使我们能够更详细地描述在世贸中心站点从危机响应过渡到随后的恢复阶段时，活动模式如何发生变化。此外，WTC接触调查问卷仅限于2002年6月30日之前的活动。然而，电信、建筑等某些职业和Fresh Kills垃圾填埋场等一些地点的工作在这一日期之后仍在继续。

Despite these limitations, the exposure assessment questionnaire provides a great deal of insight into the work done by responders to the WTC disaster. The large cohort size and the detail available from the questionnaire provide the most comprehensive description to date of the non-FDNY WTC responder population. Based on post-9/ 11 experiences at the WTC site and surrounding areas, as well as on experiences gained in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, the BP oil disaster in the Gulf, as well as the tsunami and nuclear reactor disaster in Japan, the definition of a disaster responder has become much broader and responders should be understood to include not only conventional emergency responders involved in the immediate response to the crisis, but also those workers who participate in the restoration of vital services and recovery activities which may last for years [Bradt, 2003]. This recognition makes planning for health, safety, exposure assessment, and protection of all workers in the aftermath of a disaster much more complex than previously conceived [Bradt, 2003]. 尽管有这些限制，暴露评估问卷提供了大量关于世贸中心灾难应急人员所做工作的深入了解。大队列规模和问卷的详细资料提供了迄今为止最全面的描述非fdny WTC应答人群。根据9/ 11事件后在世贸中心现场和周围地区的经验，以及在卡特里娜飓风、英国石油公司在墨西哥湾的石油灾难以及日本的海啸和核反应堆灾难之后所取得的经验，灾难响应者的定义已变得更加广泛，应理解为响应者不仅包括参与对危机立即反应的常规紧急响应者，还包括那些参与恢复重要服务和可能持续多年的恢复活动的工人[Bradt, 2003]。这一认识使得灾后健康、安全、接触评估和保护所有工作人员的规划比以前设想的要复杂得多[Bradt, 2003]。

On September 11, 2001, two planes flied into the North and South towers of the World Trade Center (WTC) complex in New York City, causing both buildings to collapse within hours, killing nearly 3,000 people. In July 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiated a monitoring and treatment program for WTC responders, spanning five clinical centers.
