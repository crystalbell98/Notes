In the Introduction to “They Say / I Say”: The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing, Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein provide templates designed to guide the structure of writing. Specifically, Graff and Birkenstein argue that the types of writing templates they offer induce more thinking. As the authors themselves put it, "the stock in trade of sophisticated thinking and writing.” Although some people believe, pre-established form undermine creativity. Graff and Birkenstein insist that those people's concept of creativity is very limit and template make people more original and creative. In sum, then, their view is that templates are tools to get you started, not structures set in stone.   I [agree/disagree/have mixed feelings]. In my view, the types of templates that the authors recommended is very helpful for beginners. For instance, foreigner learner. In addition, it can also helps native speaker write more reasonably. Some might object, of course, on the grounds that it limits the creative of the structure. Yet I would argue that compared with disorganized structure, it is better to have a perfect one to help you start. Overall, then, I believe template is an important point to make given the discussion here.  他说的A观点、论据、原话引用。他说的B观点、A对B的驳斥、A观点总结。我的观点、原因1/原因2、可能接受的反驳、对反驳的回应、总结自己的观点
