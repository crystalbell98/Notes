## Dissertation Aims
- Dissertation Proposal at the end of December.
	- Aim 0: 
		Review: education moderate the pathology and cognition relationship.
		Review: air pollution PM2.5 impact in cognition with brain pathology as mediator.
		Review: wildfire and occupation exposure to PM
	- Aim 1: WTC activity and MCI incidence, and cognitive trajectory. 
		- Feedback from SBAIN Presentation: Exploratory Factor Analyses
	- Aim 2: Longitudinal Analyses
	- Aim 3: Does WTC activity correlated with plasma/brain biomarkers. Does Education modify the relationship between brain pathology and cognition (maybe 3 way interaction as education* activity* pathology)

## Dissertation Requirements
In addition to the core and concentration requirements, doctoral students will be required to pass a preliminary written examination, submit and have approved a dissertation proposal, complete a dissertation, and submit two publishable manuscripts. Preliminary Examination Doctoral students will be required to pass a preliminary examination. The Preliminary Examination will emphasize the integration of the student's knowledge in the core areas. The successful completion of this examination will allow the student to proceed towards the formal identification of their research supervisor and supervisory committee for the preparation and defense of the doctoral dissertation requirement. The purpose of the Preliminary Examination is to test the preparedness of the student for the doctoral research phase of the program. Students will be expected to exhibit a mastery of the material covered in the three areas – quantitative analysis, research methods, and the determinants of health and disease - as well as an ability to integrate and synthesize concepts and approaches relevant to population health and clinical science research.

Dissertation

The most important requirement for the Ph.D. degree is the dissertation, which must be an original scholarly investigation that meets the standards in the field for scholarly publications. Following the successful completion of the Preliminary Examination, students may be advanced to candidacy upon successful completion of all degree requirements of the Graduate School and program, other than the graduate seminars and the dissertation requirements. The Dean of the Graduate School confers this status upon recommendation from the Doctoral Program Director. Students must advance at least one year prior to the dissertation defense.

*A proposal for the dissertation* must be prepared, *orally defended, and approved* by the student’s research supervisor or supervisory committee – appointed by the Doctoral Program Director in consultation with the student. The proposal will synthesize the literature on an important topic in population health or clinical outcomes research, and identify gaps in the literature that clearly demonstrate the importance for the student’s planned dissertation research. The topic should be broad enough to allow for the preparation of at least two publishable papers in peer-reviewed journals.
==5 introduction to committee, 30 min presentation, 30 min comments, leave and let committee discuss==

The makeup of the dissertation committee includes the dissertation supervisor (faculty *mentor*), defense *chairperson*, a *third member from the program*, and at least *one person outside of the program* or University. To avoid any potential perception of a conflict of interest, the student’s dissertation supervisor (faculty mentor) will not be able to chair their dissertation committee.

Preliminary research to develop a dissertation topic will normally begin in the second year of study and the third year will be mainly devoted to developing and refining the doctoral research.

## Intership
1. Prepare the Resume
2. Look at Indeed, resources available at school

### Self-introduction
- Mistake
	1. Failing to adopt your response to the employer and role at hand (think critically about what skills or experiences would be most appealing to the employer, and plan to emphasize those. It's all on the job posting). And Pro Tip: Always end with an explanation on what brings you here today. For example, were you looking for something more than in your past role? Position this employer as a unique solution.
	2. Repeating your resume. Instead: tell a condensed version of your professional story, aiming to focus on what you accomplished and the tangible results, not just a list of your job titles. If you're at the beginning of your career, focus on your education and your motivation to join the company and the specific role.
		1. Condense your professional story
		2. Focus on your accomplishments and tangible results
		3. Speak about your personal motivations and career aspirations
	3. Giving a chronological life history. While you do want to tell a story in order to capture your interviewer's interest, it's critical to keep your response professional and relevant. So instead of telling a chronological life history, force yourself to identify whether you have a relevant reason for sharing details about your early life. It's fine to refer to a feature of your upbringing if it's relevant. For example, if you became a dental hygienist because your mom was a dentist. But in general, don't refer to your earliest years.
	4. talking about controversial topics or personal information.  if this isn't asked by an interviewer, it's not worth mentioning hobbies in your initial response to this question, especially when it comes at the cost of sharing other relevant professional experience or making your response too long. Religion, relationships, politics, health, and even recent news stories should remain off the table.
	5. Rambling. take no more than 2-3 minutes to answer. prepare a concise answer ahead of time. Sometimes we come across differently than we think, and a recording can help to reveal that. Pro Tip: Everyone is nervous in an interview. If a lot of time has passed since the hiring manager has spoken, take a breath. Recover by saying, "wow, that was a lot. I hope you can tell I'm really excited for this opportunity!" It's better to show self-awareness if you've caught yourself speaking quickly.
1. Use present, past, and future format to structure your response.
	- Share what you've been doing most recently by giving a high-level view of your role that includes your title, responsibilities, and projects that you've worked on recently. You want to try to show a relationship with this work and the role that you're applying for. Begin with your motivation for entering the field. You don't want to just provide a timeline for how you got here.
	- addressing how you support the employer's goals and how their values align with yours, you're showing them that it's a good match and that you're invested in them.
