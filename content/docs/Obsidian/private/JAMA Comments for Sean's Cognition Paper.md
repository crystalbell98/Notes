# JAMA EDITORS’ COMMENTS:   
The JAMA editors are interested in the topic of your manuscript but found it difficult to adequately evaluate the manuscript due to the need for additional information and clarification. In responding to the comments from external peer reviewers as well as to the editorial comments below, the study will hopefully be sufficiently clarified to allow for further evaluation and to determine suitability for JAMA. Please note that if the issues below are satisfactorily addressed in the revision and if the editors remain interested in the study, additional revisions will likely be needed to address more detailed items (including detailed requests for revision of the Tables and Figures).   
1. **STUDY POPULATION**: There is likely selection bias and participation bias as to who entered the study population. Individuals had to survive dementia-free from 2001 to 2014, then they had to agree to participate, and then they had to complete 2 cognitive visits to be included in the study. To address these issues further, please:   
	- a. Remove language that suggests this is a population-based study, which does not seem accurate.   
	- b. Clearly reiterate the patient population when describing and interpreting the findings. See the language below regarding the Conclusions and Relevance statements for an example of this.   
2. **EXPOSURE**: Please clarify the following items related to the exposure:   
	- a. Clearly and plainly state what the exposure is, both in the Abstract Exposure section and in the Methods Exposure section. It seems that work activities and duration in the aftermath of 9/11 are being used as a proxy for exposure to fine particulate (and potentially neurotoxic) dust and debris, but this needs to be made explicit in these sections of the manuscript.   
	- b. Clarify exactly how the exposure was determined. Was this based on self-report from a questionnaire? When were the questions asked (ie, how long after the 9/11 exposure?) Is there a potential for recall bias?   
	- c. Clarify the methods used to categorize the exposure. Clearly state in the Methods Exposure section that there were 5 categories used for the “expert scaling” approach, if that is correct. It is not clear how the 5 exposure categories [low, moderate <15 weeks, moderate >15 weeks, high <15 weeks, high >15 weeks] are related to the 5 points scoring system mentioned on line 154. Line 150 indicates that these categories were based on expert opinion, but can the authors cite any references to help explain the rationale used in making these determinations?   
	- d. Please see external peer reviewer critiques related to combining the “low” and “PPE” groups into 1 reference group. Consider whether analysis of these 2 groups separately is warranted, either in the main analysis or as a sensitivity analysis.   
3. **OUTCOME**: Please clarify the following items related to the outcome:   
	- a. Several reviewers raised questions about the terminology of “early onset dementia”. This term should please be replaced with something like “dementia before age 65”, “cognitive impairment before age 65”, “cognitive decline before age 65”, or something similar (if that is accurate).   
	- b. Some of the criteria mentioned in the Methods Outcome section (line 129-135) to define dementia are vague. For example   
		- i. What is meant by “-1.5 SD below population means” (line 130) – what population is being used as the reference, was a specific score or threshold used?   
		- ii. How was “functional limitation” (line 132) defined and assessed?   
		- iii. How was a “reduction in global cognition” (line 133) defined, and how did this differ from the cognitive impairment described at line 130?   
		- iv. How did neuroimaging inform the diagnosis, was this obtained in any standardized way, and how many had neuroimaging?   
	- c. Please clarify whether the individuals determining the outcome (dementia) were aware of the patients’ exposure (ie, occupation, extent of exposure to potentially neurotoxic dust, use of PPE, etc). If so, this would seem to be a potential source of bias.   
4. **ANALYSES**:   
	- a. Please clarify why individuals who were found to have dementia at the first cognitive assessment were not included in the study.   
	- b. Please provide more details about the methods used to account for missing data/loss to follow up, and please clarify whether the weighting approach that was used is a standard approach to handling missing data in studies of cognitive impairment/dementia. Although this may be a technique to address loss to follow up due to fear of diagnosis/fear of stigma, there might be other reasons for loss to follow up -- such as cognitive impairment or death -- and it is not clear whether and to what extent the methods used account for these factors.   
	- c. Please clarify whether or not individuals were censored after 5 years. Potentially contradictory information appears in the manuscript (eg, line 118 vs line 208-210) and the rationale for this is not clear.   
	- d. Please clarify whether death is appropriately accounted for as a competing risk.   
	- e. If a dose-response phenomenon is claimed, please clarify exactly how this was tested statistically.   
5. **CAUSAL INTERPRETATION**:   
	- a. As an observational study, the authors should avoid the use of causal language or interpretation. Please describe in terms of “X was associated with Y” rather than the role of X, the effect of X, X caused Y, etc.   
	- b. Please avoid extrapolating to the protective effects of PPE or to commenting on all types of air pollution more generally; as noted by reviewers, these types of conclusions are difficult to support given the heterogenous nature of the low/PPE reference group and given that the WTC responders faced a scenario much different from routine exposure to air pollution.   
	- c. Please remove the calculations that involve the risk attributable to the exposure throughout the entire manuscript. Reviewers pointed out potential lack of clarity with this approach and the strong causal assumptions required.   
6. Throughout the manuscript, terms indicating a difference or lack of difference should be qualified with “**significant**” or “statistically significant”. For example, a phrase like “did not differ” should be “did not significantly differ”, and a phrase like “was associated” should be “was significantly associated”.   
7. For consistency with **JAMA style**, please make the following changes throughout the manuscript:   
	- a. Please avoid imprecise terms such as “lengthy periods” (line 70), “more dangerous activities” (line 71), etc.   
	- b. While maintaining respect and gratitude to these first responders, please revise toward a scientific tone throughout the manuscript. Please delete phrases such as “*heroes*”, “iconic Twin Towers”, “drastically elevated”, etc.   
	- c. In presenting p-values, please limit to 2 decimal places for .99 ≥ p ≥ .01; limit to 3 decimal places for .01 > p ≥ .001; and for smaller values express as “p<.001”.   
	- d. Change “average” to “mean” or “median”.   
	- e. Please refrain from using "subjects" (eg, line 196); "research participants" is more appropriate.   
1. **Title**: Please include both the exposure and the outcome in the title.   
2. Author **affiliations** and author list: Please number affiliations consecutively. Please attach the appropriate number to each author in the byline. For example:   Mary T. Smith, MD1; Nicholas Jackson, MD, MPH2; Cheryl Jones, PhD2   1 Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois   2 JAMA, Chicago, Illinois   
3. **Acknowledgements**, line 40-48: Please move this information to the Acknowledgements section at the end of the manuscript.   
	1. Acknowledgements: Please add a formal Access to Data statement for 1 academic author or at most 2 academic authors, using the standard JAMA language above.   
	2. Acknowledgements: Please revise the Role of the Sponsor statement, using the exact standard JAMA language below. If the sponsor had a role in any of these aspects of the study, including the decision to submit for publication, that role should be detailed. Specifically, it should be stated whether the sponsor had the right to veto publication or to control the decision regarding to which journal the paper was submitted.   
4. **Key Points** section: Add a Key Points section. Please see JAMA Instructions for Authors for details.   
5. **Abstract**: Please combine Design, Setting, and Participants into a single paragraph. Please add the specific study location. Add the start and end date of participant enrollment and follow up in this study. Add the total number of participants.   
	1. Abstract, Results: Please begin this section by clearly indicating the selected nature of the population. Perhaps something like “Of XX individuals in the cohort, XX were eligible for inclusion in this study of cognitive function (mean age XX; XX (%) women), and there were X cases of dementia over a mean duration of follow up of X years.”   
	2. Abstract, Results: With all presented aHR measures, please include comparative absolute rates for each group. Consider presenting quantitative results for all exposure groups, rather than just for the least and most severely exposed groups.   
	3. Abstract, Results, line 76: It is unclear what is meant by “normal” in this context, and it would probably be better to delete this.   
	4. Abstract, *Conclusions and Relevance*: Please delete and replace with a succinct summary of the main study findings without speculation or extrapolating beyond the study findings, perhaps something like “Among WTC responders who survived to participate in a longitudinal follow up study of cognition from 2014-20XX, a higher level of reported exposure to more fine particulate dust/debris, compared with the lowest reported exposure level or use of PPE, was significantly associated with higher risk of dementia before age 65 years.” This suggested language may also need to be modified, taking into account recommendations from the JAMA statistical editors below.   
6. **Methods section:** Please move statements about IRB approval and participant informed consent at the beginning of this section.   
	1. Methods section: Please reorganize the material by moving the Exposure section before the Outcomes section. Please move the information about power calculation to a separate section before the Statistical analysis section.   
	2. Methods, line 104-112: This text is difficult to understand. Please revise for clarity.   
	3. Methods, line 163-165: Please clarify what is meant by “at the time of the survey” – which survey is this? Please clarify how changes in covariates over time were handled (eg, alcohol use, smoking, etc).   
	4. Methods, line 165: Because race and ethnicity are measured in this study, please add (1) the reason for inclusion of race and ethnicity in this study, (2) who made the determination (participant, researcher, someone else), and (3) whether it was based on an open-ended question or fixed categories.   
	5. Methods, line 207: Please explicitly indicate which variables were included in the adjusted analysis. Table 2 lists some, but it is not clear that all relevant variables were included (eg, education). However, the Discussion (line 314) implies education was included.   
	6. Methods, line 212-214: Please clarify “time zero” for this study. Line 212-214 indicate time was reported as “the number of years since 9/11/2011”. However, Figure 2 seems to show increases after 1 year, yet part of the inclusion criteria for the study were that the individuals had to be free of dementia until enrollment began in 2014.   
	7. Methods, Statistical analysis, line 227: Please add significance threshold and whether testing was 1-sided or 2-sided.   
7. **Results** section: Please include comparative absolute risks (ie, incidence rates for each group) and risk differences along with 95% CI for all presented ratio measures.   
	1. Results, line 277: It is unclear what is meant by “amplified trend results” here.   
	2. Results, line 293-298: Please report quantitative values for all of these analyses, either in the main text or in the supplement. Please ensure all analyses are clearly described in the Methods section.   
	3. Results, line 298-301: Are these P-values for interaction? Please clearly label and explain methods used to generate these in the Methods section.   
8. **Discussion**, line 310-311: It is unclear what is meant by a “probable WTC exposure severity score”   
	1. Discussion, line 322-325: These findings were not clearly presented in the Results section.   
	2. Discussion, line 360-366: Please do not introduce new data or new calculations in the Discussion section.   
	3. Discussion: Please delete the “Strengths and Limitations” header. At the end of the Discussion (just before the Conclusions), please add a header termed “Limitations”. Provide a complete discussion of the study limitations in 1 or more paragraphs. These should be enumerated, eg, “First, …Second, …”. Additional limitations (in addition to those mentioned above) include that the specific etiology or subtype of dementia was not determined.   
	4. Discussion, lines 388-397: Please replace with a statement of the study's primary finding, similar to the Abstract Conclusions requested above.   
9. **Figures**: All statistical graphs in accepted manuscripts are re-created in-house using Adobe Illustrator. To facilitate preparation for publication if this manuscript is accepted, please provide graphs output directly from the software used to create them in an editable vector file format, such as .wmf or .eps, or as Excel graphs (including the linked data file), if created in Excel.

# JAMA STATISTICAL EDITORS’ COMMENTS:   
  
1. The summary of the exposure-outcome relationship is often summarized using the lowest exposure group as the reference (n=355 subjects) and then compares outcomes among the most severe exposure group (n=95 subjects) -- and such a comparison relies on approximately 10% of the total sample size. A more appropriate comparison would focus on the trends across exposure groups, and should use the large moderate exposure group (n=2928) to anchor comparisons.   
2. Figure 2 should present the cumulative incidence rather than the cumulative hazard.   
3. Please clarify the outcome ascertainment and the use of the Cox model. If cognitive evaluations occurred every 18 months then isn't the outcome highly discrete? How is this aspect addressed in the analysis (handling of ties appropriately)?   
4. Please carefully check the accuracy of the labeling of the exposure groups in all tables -- there are inconsistencies.   
5. Please do not quote p-values as stand-alone summaries. These do not communicate the magnitude of differences and should be replaced or augmented with confidence intervals.   
  
  
# Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author):   
  
The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of early-onset dementia (EOD) in a prospective study of WTC responders and to compare incidence among responders with various levels of exposure to fine particulate building debris. They compare responders with severe lengthy exposure to those with no exposure or those who wore personalized protective equipment (PPE). The study is nicely designed and executed; the analyses are appropriate. The paper is well-written but suffers from some inconsistencies and needs editing.   
  
Figure 1, lines 509-510:   
Why aren’t dementia diagnosis at baseline and missing exposure information considered to be exclusion criteria, not reasons lost to follow-up? On page 7, line 120 dementia diagnosis is listed as an exclusion criterion.   
  
Figure 1, line 510:   
The average time observed is 2.72 years and the average number of assessments is 3.15, so it seems the average time between assessments should be less than one year, not 1.5 years. Perhaps reporting all these as medians instead of means would be clearer.   
  
Outcome measure, lines 129-133:   
The outcome measure of EOD was based on, “…objective measures of cognitive decline and, when feasible, validated using structural neuroimaging”, plus evidence of functional limitations.   
Were there any neurological examinations? Who made the determination of EOD? Was there a review panel?   
  
Exposure severity, lines 157-159: Nice description of the two exposure assessment methods. The authors state they decided to report, “…findings from the expert-scaling method because they were more conservative and because we could readily explain these results.” Were the results similar? Was there an a priori plan to report the more conservative results?   
  
Exposure severity, lines 161:   
The definition here is consistent with all except lines 518-523 in Figure 2.   
  
Statistical Methods, p11:   
The timescale used was the time under observation, which began in around 2015 and ended at the earliest of: diagnosis of dementia, reaching age 65, death, or 5 years. The authors note that the average time observed was 2.72 years. Please explain, “Cumulative incidence of dementia was reported over the observational period and was recorded as the number of years since 9/11/2001.”   
  
Results, line 238: “Participants contributed an average of 3.22 observations per responder…” is inconsistent with the number in Figure 1, line 510.   
  
Table 1: if those with baseline prevalent stroke were excluded, why are there n=28 with baseline stroke?   
  
Results, lines 240-247: Nice to provide this information. I assume there is no table in the supplement.   
  
Results, lines 256-263: Please note in the text that these results are in Table 2.   
  
Results, lines 258-259: There clearly is an increasing association between exposure and EOD incidence (unadjusted IRs: 5.11-13.58-15.77-25.3-49.89), but I’m not sure I would call it a “trend-level increase.” Did the authors test for trend? The two moderate exposure groups don’t look very different, with adjusted HRs (1-2.79-2.92-4.42-6.69).   
  
Results, lines 265-268. Please edit this sentence for clarity. Perhaps insert, “as compared to”?   
  
Results, lines 277-281: I don’t understand this sentence. Are the HRs relative to the lowest exposure? Is the aHR for the most severely exposed 1.74 or 25.45?   
Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2: Please check these tables, the results appear to be the same.   
  
Results, lines 293-295: The Supplemental Table 2 described here is not what is in the supplement.   
  
Table 3, line 547:   
Definition of “Lengthy” is unnecessary as it is not used in the table.   
The second and third row labels need editing.   
  
  
Reviewer #1 (Explain how the tables/figures are inappropriate (sent to author):   
  
but need editing   
  
  
# Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author):   
  
This manuscript explores the relation between pollutant exposures (presumed to be airborne) resulting from the World Trae Center (WTC) bombing and subsequent early onset dementia (EOD) defined as before age 65. It is an interesting population and important question. Their findings of an increased risk with more exposure are important in and of themselves and may have implications for others with lower levels of more typical air pollution exposures. One important question is how the case definition comports with clinical dementia diagnoses. How full a work up is this? I have a few other issues that I think need to be addressed:   
  
1) Abstract: Need to provide the denominators for incidence rates (IR) in the abstract (and everywhere they are mentioned in the text). In one place it is per 1000 person-years. This needs to be stated everywhere an IR is given.   
2) Abstract, conclusion: the authors suggest the results are relevant for other settings with high PM exposure, but they need to make explicit that the composition of the PM that resulted from the WTC bombings may well be quite different from PM seen elsewhere. This is in general true of any PM, but it is likely even more strikingly different following the WTC bombings given what was spewed into the air. Some nod to this in the abstract is needed, but in the discussion section of the text, this needs to be expounded on more.   
3) Methods, inclusion/exclusion: it is stated that individuals were censored after 5-years of data donation. Later in the statistical analysis (p.11), though, it says “were censored either on the final day of observation, the date of death, or at age 65.” Please explain and clarify exactly what was meant here and what was done.   
4) Methods, p. 7 last line: “The diagnosis of dementia was evident…” do you mean this was your case definition? Otherwise, what do you mean by “evident”? Please make clear.   
5) Methods, outcome measure: “…accompanied by evidence of functional limitation as well as evidence of cognitive decline as indicated by a reduction in global cognition.” By this do you mean just the MOCA scores? Please make clear.   
6) Methods, outcome measure: “The diagnosis of EOD was supported by the presence of objective measures of cognitive decline and, when feasible, were validated using structural neuroimaging.” In how many of the EOD cases was such data used?   
7) Methods, mental health: “we included measures of the presence of intrusive stressful memories at enrollment into the parent study, which occurred on average 10-15 years prior to baseline cognitive assessments.” Do you mean the ones they reported occurred on average that long ago or that you only included ones that were that long ago (in which case use "that", not "which")   
8) Methods, missing data: I am not familiar with the weighting approach described. Typical weighting approaches create models that predict missingness based on other (typically baseline) data. How does your approach compare to that and why use it instead?   
9) Methods, statistical analysis, l. 214: How was stroke as a time-varying variable handled? It could be on the causal path so straight adjustment could block some of the effect of the WTC exposure (or create other problems if there remains uncontrolled confounding of the stroke-EOD association).   
10) P. 13, l.258: add “if there was” (“…to see if there was an…”)   
11) P. 14, ll.277-279: These type of results were not reported in the section above so unclear what amplified means. It's in the table, but should be in text in earlier paragraph too.   
12) P. 15, ll. 295-296: Please provide the referenced results in the supplement.   
13) Discussion and conclusion: The authors suggest that PPE was associated with less EOD, but this group was combined with those with no exposure so this statement cannot be made. If they want to make inference about PPE use, then they need to specifically compare those who were exposed and used PPE specifically with those who were in fact unexposed to dust.   
  
  
  
# Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author):   
  
This is an interesting study on a very important topic. Not only does it provide essential information on the long-term health consequences of the WTC attacks, it also is informative about potential hazards of dust and air pollution at large.   
The study is easy to follow and the results well described. I have a few comments to improve the paper:   
  
  
Line 76 and further: please mention units of the IR. Was it per 100 or 1000 person-years?   
  
Line 79: no need to mention p-values throughout manuscript, if confidence interval shown   
  
Line 97: define abbreviation EOD. Note also, that early-onset dementia is often used for familial dementia cases with autosomal dominant mutations. Perhaps simply use incidence of 'dementia' until age 65?   
  
Line 98: it says seven years, whereas in line 66 it is five years   
  
Line 99: it is a bit confusing (and problematic) to define an inclusion/exclusion criterion that can only be assessed at end of follow-up. There are two issues here: First, why not define an age at entry (i.e. start of follow-up) such that by the end of follow-up the age will be <65 years. Second, this way of delineating the cohort does not consider person-time that can be contributed by persons who were <65 years for a certain period of time including a few cognitive assessments. These persons could be censored once they reach age 65 years (even though the study itself continues). Currently, selecting the cohort based on data at the end of follow-up will potentially lead to selection bias.   
  
Line 140: in a cohort study it is logical to first describe the exposure and then the outcome (line 122)   
  
  
Line 170: while attractive to do so, it is methodologically incorrect to use as covariables factors that occurred years AFTER exposure. These could bias the results in different ways.   
  
  
Line 212: it is confusing the report the cumulative incidence as years from 2001 onwards. After all, persons with dementia already at first cognitive assessment were excluded from the cohort. In other words, the cumulative incidence will per definition be 0 until study enrolment.   
  
Line 257: Up until this point in the manuscript it was unclear there were 5 exposure categories. Please describe those in the methods section.   
  
Line 262: it would be interesting to separate out the low exposure category into two separate categories: those who reported no dust exposure and those who had high dust exposure but wore PPE. It would be interesting to see how these separate categories compare to the remaining categories in terms of their dementia risk. It is possible that more health conscious persons decided to wear PPE before commencing activities (perhaps not in the very acute phase, but in the weeks/months after).   
  
Line 284: there is no mention in the methods how PAR was calculated. Please elaborate   
  
Figure 2: it is unclear which line corresponds to which category   
  
  
# Reviewer #4 (Remarks to the Author):   
  
This manuscript investigates if having intensive job exposures to dust in WTC rescue/cleanup efforts is associated with increased rates of dementia. They use a longitudinal design leveraging data from well-characterized individuals in Long Island who self-selected for repeated surveillance. Overall, their results suggest a very large increase in rates of early onset dementia that increase with increasing exposures with the expected dose-response. This work is interesting, highly novel, and important.   
  
The work is generally well-conducted though there are a couple of key limitations that do not seem to be well-appreciated by the authors (see major comments below). In addition, some more detail could be added in places (see minor comments below).   
  
Major Comments:   
The primary concern for bias in this study is one of selection based on who enters the study. The authors have clearly laid out who appears in their clinics and then does not make it into the study. This is good but there is a much more serious concern that those workers who had higher exposures and poor health would be much more likely to self-select to go to the clinic than those in good health. This would result in an inherent bias away from the null. While an argument can be made that they looked at incident disease, dementia is a process that does not occur over night so people on that trajectory may still come to the clinic. Similarly, those who get precursors (i.e., HTN, CVD, etc) to dementia may also be more likely to enroll in the study. Its not clear that much can be done about this but any efforts to consider this would be highly valuable. Could the populations be compared to information on all responders from another source? At a minimum, this needs to be discussed in the paper as a potential issue.   
  
Selection bias the other way of the most exposed dying or developing dementia before being enrolled in the study is another point that could be raised. It could also be that the least exposed would only come in if they are having health issues. Both of these effects would have the opposite effect of leaving healthy survivors to inform their models.   
  
There are several intermediates or likely downstream consequences of exposure that the authors have adjusted for including chronic diseases and behavioral factors. This could reduce associations and should be carefully considered (likely presenting results with and without these adjustments).   
  
Why was the population restricted to those who were fluent in English? This feels problematic and at a minimum could be called out as in future studies there would be efforts to translate the materials so that the work could be more inclusive.   
  
Clarification comments:   
When was the exposure reported? Without knowing this its hard to know if there was any reporting bias based on health.   
  
If the population was required to be less that 63, it’s weird in the text to report that 87% was less than 65.   
  
It is odd to calculate risk since you do not have all of the population at risk.   
More information is needed on how you calculate attributable fraction. It also needs to be stated that these estimates require the steep assumption that your findings are causal.   
  
There needs to be something to state what about the definition makes it EOD and not just dementia.
