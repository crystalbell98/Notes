## Files Check List
- [ ] Abstract, 30 lines of text
- [ ] Project Narrative, 3 sentences
- [ ] Applicant Biosketch, 5 pages
- [ ] Sponser Biosketch, 5 pages
- [ ] Applicant Background and Goals for Fellowship Training, 6 pages
	- [ ] address both the F99 phase and the K00 phase
	- [ ] **Doctoral Dissertation and Research Experience**: Include a description of how the combination of past research experiences and the F99/K00 will contribute to achieving a long-term career goal in aging research.
	- [ ] **Training Goals and Objectives**: Describe the applicant’s *long-term career goal* in aging research and explain how the F99/K00 will enable the attainment of that goal. Describe how the *current project* and research experience will be *leveraged* for identifying and pursuing a research question within the mission of NIA. For *each phase*, describe how the proposed research training and career development *plan* will enhance the applicant's knowledge and understanding of aging-related research and expand her/his technical and professional skills, keeping in mind *existing strengths* as well as *gaps* in existing skills. It is not expected that the F99 phase includes aging research. Thus, for those individuals who are entering the field of aging research in their K00 phase, this will represent a significant research redirection. Such individuals are expected to describe their aging-relevant efforts and/or training plans (e.g., aging-relevant research skills, coursework, professional development, etc.) during both the F99 and K00 phases that provide preparation for the K00 aging research and, later, as an independent aging scientist.
	- [ ] **Activities Planned Under This Award**: Describe the scientific and professional development activities planned for each phase and explain how the activities will facilitate the transition to each subsequent career stage. Include a *timeline* with scientific, professional development, and *career milestones*. The activities planned under this award should be individually tailored and well-integrated with the research project. This should not just be a list of activities; provide justification for planned activities based on goals and existing strengths and gaps. The plan and timeline should span the entire award period, i.e., both the F99 and K00 phases.
- [x] Specific Aims, 1 page
	- [x] Specific Aims must address plans for pre- (F99) and post- (K00)doctoral phases. All applicants _must_ use these two Specific Aims:
	- [x] _Specific Aim 1: The Dissertation Research Project_: Provide a detailed description of the current research and research to be completed during the F99 phase. This phase is not required to be related to the NIA mission.
	- [x] _Specific Aim 2_: _The Postdoctoral Research Direction_: Identify research direction(s) and plans within NIA’s interest areas to be pursued during the K00 phase. For more information about the NIA’s research areas of interest, please visit the [NIA blog](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/blog) and [NIA website](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/research-divisions-contacts).
- [ ] Research Strategy, 6 pages
	- [x] _If the applicant is proposing to gain experience in a clinical trial as part of his or her research training_, describe the relationship of the proposed research project to the clinical trial. Since data sharing promotes new ideas and advances science, new data and novel methods and approaches are recommended to be shared with the public. Applicants should address the Significance and Approach for each Specific Aim individually.
	- [x] _Specific Aim 1: Dissertation Research Project_
		- [x] _Significance_: Provide a thoughtful overview of the dissertation research, including the scientific question being addressed and its potential impact, and the scientific approaches, strategies, techniques, methodologies, skill sets, etc., acquired during graduate training that can be applied to aging research.
		- [x] _Approach_: Provide an overview of the dissertation research, including the background, goal, rationale, and hypotheses of the research project(s). The Approach for this Aim should be organized into two sections:
			- [ ] A *progress report* on the dissertation research project thus far, including the approaches used, research outcomes obtained, and important methodologies learned. Describe plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project.
			- [ ] A detailed *research proposal* for the work *to be completed in the F99* phase, including *rigorous experimental design*, anticipated results, potential problems, alternative strategies, and potential follow-up studies. Detail *how* the rigorous experimental design will *achieve robust and unbiased results*. Highlight *connections to aging* research and the *K00* aging research phase in terms of approaches, strategies, techniques, methodologies, skill sets, etc.
	- [ ] _Specific Aim 2: Postdoctoral Research Direction_
		- [ ] _Significance_: Explain the significance of the K00 aging research direction. Describe a specific question or observation that might be investigated. Explain how this question or observation is related to NIA’s and the applicant's research interests. Make sure to include how your work will advance the field of aging and/or promote prevention, diagnosis, and prognosis of age-related diseases and promote health span and/or lifespan. Explain how this question or observation is related to NIA's and the applicant's research interests and builds on skills acquired in the F99 phase. Applicants are highly encouraged to discuss their K00 phase research aims with a potential postdoctoral mentor and a NIA Program Officer and to make a clear connection between the proposed research and aging.
		- [ ] _Approach_: Provide a *general description* of how the research might be conducted, including approaches and *methodologies* to be used, *anticipated results*, *challenges* that might arise, and *pitfalls* of the approaches and *how to address them*. Explain how your previous training, especially if your K00 is associated with research redirection, will propel you onto an aging-focused research career path. Provide a *strategy and plan for identifying a K00 mentor*, independent of having already identified a K00 mentor or not, including *specific attributes of the K00 mentor* and features of the postdoctoral scientific environment that would benefit the proposed research and research training. Individuals who are entering the field of aging research in the K00 phase should strategize and plan for identifying K00 postdoctoral mentor(s) *with sufficient funds, expertise in aging research, and mentoring history* who can provide comprehensive training and guidance onto an aging-focused research career path.

# Research Career Development
- Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP)
	- The Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) emphasizes the importance of timely proposal submission to external sponsors. Starting March 4, 2019, all administrative aspects of a proposal need to be finalized five business days before the sponsor's deadline, while the complete proposal, including scientific details, should be ready two business days before the deadline. OSP specialists may request changes to ensure compliance with university and sponsor policies. All alterations requested by OSP should be finalized by 9 AM on the sponsor's deadline day. For electronic submissions, OSP should have access to the proposal five days in advance. On-time submissions to OSP receive priority. Proposals not adhering to the two-business-day rule require a waiver request. Additionally, department-specific lead-time policies should be followed. OSP closes at 5PM, and no after-hours submissions will be entertained, regardless of the sponsor's deadline.
