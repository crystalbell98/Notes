		- **Developing a Philosophy of Teaching Statement**
		- When asked to write a statement on their philosophy of teaching, many college teachers react in the same way as professionals, athletes, or artists might if asked to articulate their goals and how to achieve them: "Why should I spend time writing this down? Why can't I just do it?" For action-oriented individuals, the request to write down one's philosophy is not only mildly irritating, but causes some anxiety about where to begin. Just what is meant by a philosophy of teaching statement anyway? 当被要求写一份关于他们的教学理念的声明时，许多大学教师的反应与专业人士、运动员或艺术家在被要求阐明他们的目标以及如何实现这些目标时可能的反应相同：“我为什么要花时间写下来？ 为什么我就不能这么做呢？” 对于以行动为导向的人来说，写下自己的哲学的要求不仅有点令人恼火，而且会导致一些不知道从哪里开始的焦虑。 教学哲学陈述究竟意味着什么？
		- In the current academic climate it is likely that most faculty will be asked for such a statement at some point during their careers. The emphasis on portfolios for personnel decision making, new commitment by institutions to the teaching mission, and the tight academic job market have stimulated more requests of college teachers to articulate their philosophies. At many colleges and universities the philosophy of teaching statement is becoming a regular part of the dossier for promotion and tenure and the faculty candidate application package. Such statements are often requested of nominees for teaching awards or applicants for funds for innovative educational projects. 在当前的学术氛围下，大多数教师可能会在其职业生涯的某个时刻被要求提供这样的声明。 对人事决策的重视、机构对教学使命的新承诺以及紧张的学术就业市场刺激了大学教师更多地要求阐明他们的理念。 在许多学院和大学，教学理念陈述正在成为晋升和终身教职档案以及教师候选人申请包的常规部分。 教学奖提名者或创新教育项目资金申请人通常会被要求提供此类声明。
		-  Besides fulfilling requirements, statements of teaching philosophy can be used to stimulate reflection on teaching. The act of taking time to consider one's goals, actions, and vision provides an opportunity for development that can be personally and professionally enriching. Reviewing and revising former statements of teaching philosophy can help teachers to reflect on their growth and renew their dedication to the goals and values that they hold. 除了满足要求外，教学理念的陈述也可以用来激发对教学的反思。 花时间考虑自己的目标、行动和愿景提供了一个可以丰富个人和职业的发展机会。 回顾和修改以前的教学理念陈述可以帮助教师反思自己的成长并重新致力于他们所持有的目标和价值观。
		- The **Format of the Statement**: One of the hallmarks of a philosophy of teaching statement is its individuality. However, some general format guidelines can be suggested: 陈述的格式：教学哲学陈述的标志之一是其个性。 但是，可以建议一些通用格式指南：
			- Most philosophy of teaching statements are brief, one or two pages long at most. For some purposes, an extended description is appropriate, but length should suit the context. 大多数教学哲学陈述都很简短，最多一两页。 出于某些目的，扩展描述是合适的，但长度应适合上下文。
			- Most statements avoid technical terms and favor language and concepts that can be broadly appreciated. If the statement is for specialists, a more technical approach can be used. A general rule is that the statement should be written with the audience in mind. 大多数陈述都避免使用技术术语，而倾向于采用可被广泛理解的语言和概念。 如果该声明是针对专家的，则可以使用更具技术性的方法。 一般规则是，撰写声明时应考虑到听众。
			- Narrative, first-person approaches are generally appropriate. In some fields, a more creative approach, such as a poem, might be appropriate and valued; but in most, a straightforward, well- organized statement is preferred. 第一人称叙述方式通常是合适的。 在某些领域，更具创造性的方法（例如诗歌）可能是合适且有价值的； 但在大多数情况下，更喜欢直接、组织良好的声明。
			- The statement should be reflective and personal. What brings a teaching philosophy to life is the extent to which it creates a vivid portrait of a person who is intentional about teaching practices and committed to career. 声明应该是反思性的和个人的。 教学理念的生命力取决于它在多大程度上生动地描绘了一个致力于教学实践和致力于职业生涯的人。
		- **Components of the Statement** The main components of philosophy of teaching statements are descriptions of how the teachers think learning occurs, how they think they can intervene in this process, what chief goals they have for students, and what actions they take to implement their intentions. 陈述的组成部分 教学哲学陈述的主要组成部分是描述教师如何看待学习发生，他们认为他们如何干预这个过程，他们对学生的主要目标是什么，以及他们采取什么行动来实现他们的意图。
			-  **Conceptualization of Learning**
				- Interestingly, most college teachers agree that one of their main functions is to facilitate student learning; yet most draw a blank when asked how learning occurs. This is likely due to the fact that their ideas about this are intuitive and based on experiential learning, rather than on a consciously articulated theory. Most have not studied the literature on college student learning and development nor learned a vocabulary to describe their thinking. The task of articulating a conceptualization of learning is therefore difficult. 有趣的是，大多数大学教师都认为他们的主要职能之一是促进学生学习； 然而，当被问及学习是如何发生时，大多数人却茫然无措。 这可能是因为他们对此的想法是直观的并且基于经验学习，而不是基于有意识地阐明的理论。 大多数人没有研究过有关大学生学习和发展的文献，也没有学习过描述他们思维的词汇。 因此，阐明学习概念化的任务是困难的。
				- Many college teachers have approached the work of describing how they think student learning occurs through the use of metaphor. Drawing comparisons with known entities can stimulate thinking, whether or not the metaphor is actually used in the statement. For example, when asked to provide a metaphor, one teacher described student learning in terms of an amoeba. He detailed how the organism relates to its environment in terms of permeable membranes, movement, and the richness of the environment, translating these into the teaching-learning context by drawing comparisons with how students reach out and acquire knowledge and how teachers can provide a rich environment. Grasha (1996) has done extensive exploration of the metaphors that college students and teachers use to describe teaching and learning. An earlier classic that also contains an exploration of metaphors of teaching and learning is Israel Scheffler's The Language of Education (1960). Reinsmith (1994) applies the idea of archetypes to teaching. Such works might be consulted for ideas. 许多大学教师已经开始通过使用隐喻来描述他们认为学生学习是如何发生的。 与已知实体进行比较可以激发思考，无论陈述中是否实际使用了隐喻。 例如，当要求提供一个比喻时，一位老师用阿米巴原虫来描述学生的学习。 他详细介绍了生物体如何在渗透膜、运动和环境的丰富性方面与其环境相关，通过与学生如何接触和获取知识以及教师如何提供丰富的知识进行比较，将这些转化为教学环境。 环境。 Grasha（1996）对大学生和教师用来描述教学和学习的隐喻进行了广泛的探索。 以色列·谢夫勒 (Israel Scheffler) 的《教育语言》(1960) 是一部早期经典著作，其中也包含了对教学隐喻的探索。 Reinsmith (1994) 将原型的概念应用于教学。 可以参考此类作品来获取想法。
				- A more direct approach is for teachers to describe what they think occurs during a learning episode, based on their observation and experience or based on current literature on teaching and learning. Some useful sources that summarize current notions of learning in a very accessible way are contained in Svinicki (1991), Weinstein & Meyer (1991), and Bruning (1994). Teachers can also summarize what they have observed in their own practice about the different learning styles that students display, the different tempos they exhibit, the way they react to failure, and the like. Such descriptions can display the richness of experience and the teacher's sensitivity to student learning.更直接的方法是教师根据他们的观察和经验或基于当前的教学文献来描述他们认为在学习过程中发生的事情。 Svinicki (1991)、Weinstein & Meyer (1991) 和 Bruning (1994) 中包含一些有用的资料，它们以一种非常容易理解的方式总结了当前的学习概念。 教师还可以总结他们在自己的实践中观察到的学生表现出的不同学习风格、表现出的不同节奏、他们对失败的反应方式等。 这样的描述可以显示经验的丰富性和教师对学生学习的敏感度。
			    - _How does learning take place?_
			    - _Based on my observation and experience, what do I think happens during a learning episode_
			- **Conceptualization of Teaching**
				- Ideas on how teachers can facilitate the learning process follow from the model of student learning that has been described. If metaphors have been used, the teacher role can be an extension of the metaphor. For example, if student learning has been described as the information processing done by a computer, is the teacher the computer technician, the software, the database? If more direct descriptions of student learning have been articulated, what is the role of the teacher with respect to motivation? To content? To feedback and assessment? To challenge and support? How can the teacher respond to different learning styles, help students who are frustrated, accommodate different abilities? 关于教师如何促进学习过程的想法遵循已描述的学生学习模型。 如果使用了隐喻，教师的角色可以是隐喻的延伸。 例如，如果学生的学习被描述为计算机完成的信息处理，那么教师是计算机技术人员、软件还是计算机？数据库？ 如果对学生的学习有更直接的描述，那么教师在动机方面的作用是什么？ 内容？ 进行反馈和评估？ 挑战和支持？ 老师如何应对不同的学习风格，帮助失意的学生，适应不同的能力？
				- _How do I facilitate learning?_
				- _What are my assumptions about teaching?_
				- _Why do I teach the way I do?_
				- _How do I motivate, challenge, or support students?_
				- _How do I deal with students who struggle?_
				- _How do I vary my approach?_
			- **Goals for Students**
				- Describing the teacher role entails detailing how the teacher can help students learn, not only a given body of content, but also process skills, such as critical thinking, writing, and problem solving. It also includes one's thoughts on lifelong learning - how teachers can help students to value and nurture their intellectual curiosity, live ethical lives, and have productive careers. For most teachers, it is easier to begin with content goals, such as wanting students to understand certain aerodynamic design principles or the treatment of hypertension. The related process goals, such as engineering problem solving or medical diagnostic skills, might be described next. Finally, career and lifelong goals, such as team work, ethics, and social commitment, can be detailed. 描述教师角色需要详细说明教师如何帮助学生学习，不仅包括特定的内容，还包括过程技能，例如批判性思维、写作和解决问题。 它还包括一个人对终身学习的想法——教师如何帮助学生重视和培养他们的求知欲，过上有道德的生活，并拥有富有成效的职业生涯。 对于大多数教师来说，从内容目标开始更容易，例如希望学生了解某些空气动力学设计原理或高血压的治疗。 接下来可能会描述相关的过程目标，例如工程问题解决或医疗诊断技能。 最后，可以详细说明职业和终身目标，例如团队合作、道德和社会承诺。
			    - _As a result of learning, what do I expect my students to know, do, or value (in their careers and future lives)? Why?_
			    - _What does my teaching philosophy mean for my students?_
			- **Implementation and Assessment**
				- An extremely important part of a philosophy of teaching statement is the description of how one's concepts about teaching and learning and goals for students are translated into action. For most readers, this part of the statement is the most revealing and the most memorable. It is also generally more pleasurable and less challenging to write. Here, college teachers describe how they conduct classes, mentor students, develop instructional resources, or grade performance. They provide details on what instructional strategies they use on a day-to-day basis. It is in this section that teachers can display their creativity, enthusiasm, and wisdom. They can describe how their No Fault Test System or videotaping technique for promoting group leadership skills implements their notions of how teachers can facilitate learning. They can portray what they want a student to experience in the classes they teach, the labs they oversee, the independent projects they supervise. They can describe their own energy level, the qualities they try to exhibit as a model and coach, the climate they try to establish in the settings in which they teach. 教学理念陈述中极其重要的部分是描述如何将教学理念和学生目标转化为行动。 对于大多数读者来说，这句话是最有启发性、最令人难忘的。 写作通常也更令人愉快且挑战性更小。 在这里，大学教师描述了他们如何授课、指导学生、开发教学资源或对表现进行评分。 他们提供了有关他们日常使用的教学策略的详细信息。 正是在这个部分，教师可以展示他们的创造力、热情和智慧。 他们可以描述他们的无过失测试系统或用于提升小组领导技能的录像技术如何实现他们关于教师如何促进学习的理念。 他们可以描绘他们希望学生在他们教授的课程、他们监督的实验室、他们监督的独立项目中体验到的内容。 他们可以描述自己的能量水平、他们作为模特和教练试图展现的品质、他们试图在教学环境中建立的氛围。
			    - _How are my conceptions of teaching and learning transformed into instructional strategies?_
			    - _What are the consequences of my instructional strategies?_
			    - _How do I know my teaching is effective?_
			    - _What data do I use to gauge my effectiveness?_
			- **Your Future as a Successful University Teacher (Personal Growth Plan)**
				- For some purposes, including a section on one's personal growth as a teacher is also important in a statement of teaching philosophy. This reflective component can illustrate how one has grown in teaching over the years, what challenges exist at the present, and what long-term goals are projected. In writing this section, it helps to think about how one's concepts as well as actions have changed over time. It might be stimulating to look at old syllabi or instructional resources one has created, asking about implicit assumptions behind these products. Dialogue with colleagues, comparison of practices with goals, and examination of student or peer feedback on teaching might help with the task of enumerating present questions, puzzles, and challenges. From these, a vision of the teacher one wants to become will emerge. Describing that teacher can be a very effective way to conclude a philosophy of teaching statement. 出于某些目的，在教学理念的陈述中包含有关教师个人成长的部分也很重要。 这一反思部分可以说明多年来在教学中如何成长、目前存在哪些挑战以及预计的长期目标是什么。 在撰写本节时，思考一个人的概念和行为如何随着时间的推移而变化是有帮助的。 查看人们创建的旧教学大纲或教学资源，询问这些产品背后的隐含假设可能会令人兴奋。 与同事的对话、实践与目标的比较以及学生或同伴对教学的反馈的检查可能有助于列举当前的问题、困惑和挑战。 由此，一个人想成为的教师的愿景就会浮现出来。 描述那位老师可能是总结教学哲学陈述的一种非常有效的方式。
				- Examples of Statements By far, the best philosophy of teaching statement examples for most college teachers are those of peers who teach in similar settings or disciplines. Since statements tend to be tailored to specific contexts, peer examples are thus highly appropriate models. Dialogue with colleagues on these statements can help to stimulate ideas for one's own statement as well. Other examples are contained in several recent books on teaching portfolios, such as Seldin (1993) and O'Neil & Wright (1993). Reflective books on effective college teaching often contain extensive descriptions of teaching philosophies, such as the chapter on "Developing a Personal Vision of Teaching" in Brookfield's The Skillful Teacher (1990) and "Three Teaching Principles" in Louis Schmier's Random Thoughts (1995). 陈述示例 到目前为止，对于大多数大学教师来说，教授陈述示例的最佳理念是那些在类似环境或学科中教学的同行。 由于陈述往往是针对特定上下文而定制的，因此同行示例是非常合适的模型。 与同事就这些陈述进行对话也有助于激发自己陈述的想法。其他例子包含在最近几本关于教学档案的书中，例如 Seldin (1993) 和 O'Neil & Wright (1993)。 关于有效大学教学的反思性书籍通常包含对教学理念的广泛描述，例如布鲁克菲尔德的《熟练的教师》（1990）中的“发展个人教学愿景”一章和路易斯·施米尔的《随机思想》（1995）中的“三个教学原则”。

## Teaching Statement Examples
### Epidemiology Graduates from UM
From determining what behaviors, genes, and risk factors affect the development of certain cancers, to preventing the spread of HIV through sex education and the evaluation of needle exchange programs, to averting the outbreak of salmonella, the field of public health, and particularly, epidemiology, is rewarding and gratifying. As an epidemiologist, I am thrilled to be in a discipline whose aim is to understand diseases and disease processes so that the health and lives of everyone can be improved. I have always desired a career in health that would impact people’s lives, however I confess I had not always known whether such a career existed. There is a well-known idea within the public health realm that the best public health is not seen – it is the diseases, accidents, and outbreaks that were avoided – but these efforts also limit the awareness and importance of the work that is done and the field itself. One of my main objectives as an educator in epidemiology is to foster an overall appreciation and recognition for the discipline, especially for students in other areas of public or clinical health. For students planning a career in epidemiology, I anticipate cultivating and refining the critical thinking, communication, and methodological skills necessary for these future public health workers to be successful in their research and careers so that they could then go on to improve the lives of many more people.从确定哪些行为、基因和风险因素影响某些癌症的发展，到通过性教育和针头交换计划评估来预防艾滋病毒的传播，到避免沙门氏菌的爆发，公共卫生领域，特别是， 流行病学，是有益且令人欣慰的。 作为一名流行病学家，我很高兴能够进入一个旨在了解疾病和疾病过程的学科，以便改善每个人的健康和生活。 我一直渴望从事能够影响人们生活的健康事业，但我承认我并不总是知道这样的职业是否存在。 公共卫生领域有一个众所周知的观点，即最好的公共卫生是看不见的——而是避免了疾病、事故和疫情——但这些努力也限制了人们对所做工作的认识和重要性， 领域本身。 作为流行病学教育者，我的主要目标之一是培养对该学科的整体欣赏和认可，特别是对于公共卫生或临床健康其他领域的学生。 对于计划从事流行病学职业的学生，我预计培养和完善这些未来公共卫生工作者在研究和职业生涯中取得成功所必需的批判性思维、沟通和方法技能，以便他们能够继续改善许多人的生活 更多的人。

My personal experience with learning the epidemiological concepts and methods has involved a mix of traditional lectures and applied practice, and I intend to incorporate both of these processes in my own teaching. Fortunately, the manner of teaching epidemiology can be easily tailored to the various learning styles of the students, which can be gauged through solicitation of feedback in the form of course evaluations and surveying students early in the semester, as well as through performance on assignments and exams and class participation. The reality, though, is that epidemiology is a broad field and no amount of coursework can cover all the content, so focusing on teaching the methodology and developing the critical thinking and communication skills necessary for students to be successful in their own preferred area of research is most important. Since students have a variety of health interests, which are often fueled by their own personal experiences with certain diseases, finding what appeals to them and developing assignments, discussions, and examples tailored to their passions is the best strategy to learn these skills. 我个人学习流行病学概念和方法的经验涉及传统讲座和应用实践的结合，我打算将这两个过程纳入我自己的教学中。 幸运的是，流行病学的教学方式可以很容易地根据学生的不同学习风格进行调整，这可以通过以课程评估和学期初调查学生的形式征求反馈，以及通过作业和学习的表现来衡量。 考试和课堂参与。 但现实情况是，流行病学是一个广阔的领域，任何课程都无法涵盖所有内容，因此，重点是教授方法论并培养学生在自己喜欢的研究领域取得成功所必需的批判性思维和沟通技巧 是最重要的。 由于学生有各种各样的健康兴趣，而这些兴趣往往是由他们自己对某些疾病的个人经历所推动的，因此找到对他们有吸引力的东西并根据他们的兴趣制定作业、讨论和示例是学习这些技能的最佳策略。

To enhance the learning, it is vital that an educator recognizes students’ different learning styles and incorporates a variety of teaching strategies. I applied this idea while a graduate student instructor for an Introduction to Epidemiology for non-epidemiology students. Most students are resistant to taking this class because of a lack of confidence with and a fear of math and statistics. Further, many do not understand the relevance of epidemiology to their own disciplines. As a result, students usually begin the course with a negative attitude. To overcome these challenges, we presented the same material in a variety of ways, including creating reading and lecture guides for students who rely more on literary material, constructing practice problems for students who prefer application, and offering tutoring sessions for students who required more one-on-one interaction. We also tailored homework problems to relate to their different disciplines, so that students can see how their knowledge of epidemiology methods can enhance the understanding and growth in their own fields. Throughout the semester of teaching this course, I maintained a positive attitude and passion for the material and while students were not necessarily eager to become epidemiologists by the end of the class, they did finish the course with a greater appreciation for epidemiology research and methodology and a friendlier demeanor and attitude towards epidemiology as a whole. 为了提高学习效果，教育者必须认识到学生不同的学习方式并采用各种教学策略。 我在担任研究生讲师时应用了这个想法，为非流行病学学生教授流行病学导论。 大多数学生因为对数学和统计学缺乏信心和恐惧而拒绝参加这门课程。 此外，许多人不了解流行病学与他们自己学科的相关性。 因此，学生通常以消极的态度开始课程。 为了克服这些挑战，我们以多种方式呈现相同的材料，包括为更依赖文学材料的学生创建阅读和讲座指南，为更喜欢应用的学生构建练习问题，以及为需要更多材料的学生提供辅导课程 一对一互动。 我们还为学生量身定制了与不同学科相关的作业问题，让学生看到他们对流行病学方法的了解如何能够增强对自己领域的理解和成长。 在教授这门课程的整个学期中，我对材料保持着积极的态度和热情，虽然学生不一定渴望在课程结束时成为流行病学家，但他们确实以对流行病学研究和方法的更大欣赏完成了课程，并且 对整个流行病学的态度和态度更加友好。

While it is vital to employ reliable teaching strategies in the classroom, I strongly believe that the attitude I maintain while in the classroom greatly enhances the learning. Whether I am working with epidemiology or non-epidemiology students, my general approach to teaching remains the same: to possess a genuine care and respect for my students and to maintain a constant curiosity and growth for knowledge of the field. 虽然在课堂上采用可靠的教学策略至关重要，但我坚信，我在课堂上保持的态度可以极大地提高学习效果。 无论我是与流行病学学生还是非流行病学学生一起工作，我的总体教学方法都是一样的：对学生抱有真正的关心和尊重，并保持对该领域知识的持续好奇心和增长。

The great impact a professor’s teaching compassion can have on students was evident to me while I was a student taking a chronic disease epidemiology course, which obligates students to apply what was learned in previous introductory classes with the culmination of a mock-NIH grant proposal. It can be challenging class and students often struggle with the writing. I recall the professor recognizing the students’ anxiety and making herself available on a Saturday to meet with each student individually about their proposal. Based on my experience with this course, I realized that as an educator it is important to sincerely care about your students and to appropriately demonstrate this care in a way that is supportive to each student’s needs and learning style. In contrast, I also interacted with the graduate student instructor of this course who was not timely over email and was defensive when I posed questions about my homework and my scores. As a doctoral student, I have since had an opportunity to be a graduate student instructor twice for this same course and because of the negative experience I had with my graduate student instructor, I made a conscious effort to be open to listening to the students' questions, ready to explain what they may have misunderstood, and to be accessible beyond my obligatory office hours. I recognized that students employ a variety of coping strategies when handling challenging material, and I therefore learned to interact with students differently depending on their needs. Furthermore, students who recognize and appreciate that their instructors have gone above and beyond what is necessary typically work hard to ensure that the additional effort and time given to them was not in vain. 当我还是一名选修慢性病流行病学课程的学生时，教授的教学同情心对学生的巨大影响就显而易见了，这门课程要求学生应用在之前的入门课程中学到的知识，并最终获得模拟 NIH 拨款提案。 这门课很有挑战性，学生们常常在写作上遇到困难。 我记得教授认识到学生们的焦虑，并在周六安排自己与每个学生单独会面，讨论他们的提案。 根据我在这门课程上的经验，我意识到作为一名教育者，真诚地关心你的学生并以支持每个学生的需求和学习方式的方式适当地表现出这种关心是很重要的。 相比之下，我还与这门课程的研究生导师进行了互动，但当我提出有关我的作业和分数的问题时，他并不及时通过电子邮件进行辩护。 作为一名博士生，此后我有机会两次担任同一门课程的研究生导师，由于我与研究生导师的负面经历，我有意识地努力以开放的态度倾听学生的意见 问题，准备解释他们可能误解的内容，并在我的强制办公时间之外与您联系。 我认识到学生在处理具有挑战性的材料时会采用各种应对策略，因此我学会了根据学生的需求以不同的方式与他们互动。 此外，那些认识到并欣赏导师已经超出必要范围的学生通常会努力工作，以确保给予他们的额外努力和时间不会白费。

I also believe that a good teacher is one who is not only competent in their field, but is also always striving to learn more. Proficiency in ones field fosters confidence, which is important when one needs to exhibit authority over a class. However, I also feel that educators who recognize that they do not know everything (and are not ashamed to admit it), but who aim to constantly improve their own knowledge can better relate to students because they continue to be students themselves. The field of epidemiology is constantly growing, and my research focus on the developmental origins of disease and health is an area that is rapidly growing. I recognize that I still have a lot to learn and I would like to not only continue to make contributions to my field, but to continue to inform students about the newest methodologies. 我还相信，一位好老师不仅在自己的领域有能力，而且总是努力学习更多。 精通某个领域可以增强信心，当一个人需要在班级中表现出权威时，这一点很重要。 然而，我也觉得那些认识到自己并不知道一切（并且不羞于承认这一点）但致力于不断提高自己的知识的教育工作者可以更好地与学生建立联系，因为他们自己仍然是学生。 流行病学领域在不断发展，我的研究重点是疾病和健康的发展起源，这是一个快速发展的领域。 我认识到我还有很多东西需要学习，我不仅想继续为我的领域做出贡献，而且想继续向学生介绍最新的方法。

The field of public health and epidemiology is humbling and under-appreciated. As students and professionals become absorbed in the methodology, terminology and content, it is easy to lose sight of the overarching motivation to improve people’s health. I believe that approaching my teaching with compassion, respect, patience, and curiosity ensures that my students will garner the same attitude when they are doing their own research or in their own interactions with people as public health professionals. 公共卫生和流行病学领域是令人谦卑且未被充分认识的。 当学生和专业人士专注于方法、术语和内容时，很容易忽视改善人们健康的首要动机。 我相信，以同情、尊重、耐心和好奇心对待我的教学，可以确保我的学生在进行自己的研究或作为公共卫生专业人员与人们互动时也能获得同样的态度。


### Psychology
In psychology ... , we have wholes which, instead of being the sum of parts existing independently, give their parts specific functions or properties that can only be defined in relation to the whole in question 在心理学中......，我们有整体，而不是独立存在的部分的总和，而是赋予其部分特定的功能或属性，这些功能或属性只能根据所讨论的整体来定义
The above quote from a Gestalt theorist embodies what has become the core of my teaching philosophy: the importance of understanding the whole-part relationship over studying parts in isolation. As a lifespan developmental psychologist, I am trained to be mindful of the "big picture." I consider not only the current contexts in which individuals live, but also the past and the broader cultural and historical factors that shape people's lives. My commitment to understanding this "bigger picture" is reflected in my teaching in a variety of ways: first, in the learning goals I set for my students (specifically, at the course-specific level, the content-specific level, and the broader level of skills learning); second, in the way I view my relationship with my students and their relationships with each other; and third, in my own growth and future goals as a teacher. 上述格式塔理论家的引述体现了我的教学理念的核心：理解整体与部分关系比孤立地研究事物的重要性。 作为一名终身发展心理学家，我接受的训练是要关注“大局”。 我不仅考虑个人当前的生活环境，还考虑过去以及塑造人们生活的更广泛的文化和历史因素。 我对理解这个“更大的图景”的承诺体现在我的教学中的多种方式：首先，在我为学生设定的学习目标中（具体来说，在特定于课程的层面、特定于内容的层面以及更广泛的层面上） 技能学习水平）； 第二，我如何看待我与学生的关系以及他们之间的关系； 第三，我自己的成长和作为一名教师的未来目标。


At the content-specific level, I want my students to understand the big picture of psychology. In order to help them achieve this goal, I encourage them to interpret real-life experiences through the lens of psychology. For instance, in my discussion sections of Introduction to Developmental Psychology, I challenged my students to consider how the developmentally-relevant phenomena we were addressing, such as identity-formation during adolescence, played out in their own lives and helped shape them as individuals. I also brought in relevant articles from the popular press to spark discussions of real-world events from a developmental psychology perspective. I believe that contextualizing the material in such ways leads to greater actual integration and recollection. 在具体内容的层面上，我希望我的学生了解心理学的大局。 为了帮助他们实现这一目标，我鼓励他们通过心理学的视角来解释现实生活的经历。 例如，在《发展心理学导论》的讨论部分，我要求学生考虑我们正在讨论的与发展相关的现象，例如青春期的身份形成，如何在他们自己的生活中发挥作用，并帮助他们塑造个人。 我还引入了大众媒体的相关文章，从发展心理学的角度引发对现实世界事件的讨论。 我相信，以这种方式将材料置于情境中可以带来更好的实际整合和回忆。

At the most abstract but what l view as the most impo1tant level, I want my students to develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Several examples illustrate my commitment to strengthening students' ability to think critically. In my research methods class, students were required to critically evaluate several research articles. I encouraged them to move beyond superficial critiques, such as writing style problems or small sample sizes, and to focus instead on deeper issues, such as mismatch between hypotheses and methods or discrepancies between the data presented and the authors' interpretations. In keeping with one of the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology, that learning occurs through restructuring and insight, I also encouraged students to think critically about their own work and the work of their classmates, by allowing students to revise drafts of assignments and by requiring peer review. These kinds of critical thinking skills are essential beyond the boundaries of the classroom. To illustrate the applicability of these skills, I have utilized a number of in-class activities. For example, I designed a fun and engaging activity for the last day of the research methods class. Students were required to use the skills they had learned throughout the semester in a unique way that forced them to think critically and "outside the box" of psychology. They were asked to devise a research study (complete with research questions, hypotheses, an analysis plan, results, conclusions, and limitations) based on an amusing and randomly-assigned phenomenon (such as "Red States vs. Blue States") and population (such as "superheroes"). These activities help train students to think critically not only about psychology but also about the world around them. 在最抽象但我认为最重要的层面上，我希望我的学生培养解决问题和批判性思维的能力。 有几个例子说明了我致力于加强学生批判性思考能力的承诺。 在我的研究方法课上，学生被要求批判性地评估几篇研究文章。 我鼓励他们超越肤浅的批评，例如写作风格问题或小样本量，而关注更深层次的问题，例如假设和方法之间的不匹配或所提供的数据与作者的解释之间的差异。 为了符合格式塔心理学的基本原则之一，即学习是通过重组和洞察力进行的，我还鼓励学生批判性地思考自己和同学的工作，允许学生修改作业草稿并要求同伴 审查。 这些批判性思维技能对于超越课堂界限至关重要。 为了说明这些技能的适用性，我利用了一些课堂活动。 例如，我为研究方法课程的最后一天设计了一项有趣且引人入胜的活动。 学生被要求以独特的方式运用他们在整个学期学到的技能，迫使他们批判性地思考并“跳出心理学的框框”。 他们被要求根据有趣且随机分配的现象（例如“红州与蓝州”）和人口设计一项研究（包括研究问题、假设、分析计划、结果、结论和局限性） （例如“超级英雄”）。 这些活动有助于训练学生不仅批判性地思考心理学，而且批判性地思考他们周围的世界。

In addition to learning goals, I also place great importance on my relationship with my students and their relationships with each other. Psychology, of all disciplines, should be taught with the whole person in mind. To this end, I strive to get to know my students as individuals with unique life stories, motivations, and goals. I start by providing an information sheet for students to fill out on the first day of class to learn about students' experiences in psychology, their learning styles, their career aspirations, and any special constraints or issues involved in their participation in the class. I try to be as flexible as possible: for instance, by carefully considering my materials and modifying them accordingly for students with disabilities, or by teaching in a variety of styles (lectures, group work, etc.) to suit different learning needs. I encourage students to come to my office hours so I can meet them individually. By being enthusiastic, open-minded, friendly, and humorous, I create a warm, open, and safe environment both in my classroom and outside of it. Such an environment allows students to freely communicate, feel respected, take intellectual risks, and safely question their assumptions. To further foster a truly inclusive learning environment, I believe it is also necessary for students to see each other and me as "wholes," rather than as the sum of parts: "Asian," "male," "heterosexual," "African American," "student," "female," "teacher." Thus, I frequently use group and pair work to promote interactions among students, and strategically utilize discussions and activities to emphasize the universality and diversity of our collective life experiences. Finally, from the beginning of a course I make it clear to my students that in assessing their success in meeting the objectives of that specific course, I consider more than simply the sum of various mechanical "parts" (e.g., paper grades); rather, I also reflect on the individual as a whole, with particular attention paid to effort and improvement across the course. 除了学习目标之外，我还非常重视我与学生的关系以及他们之间的关系。 在所有学科中，心理学的教学都应该考虑到整个人。 为此，我努力了解我的学生，他们有独特的生活故事、动机和目标。 我首先提供一份信息表，供学生在上课第一天填写，以了解学生的心理学经历、他们的学习风格、他们的职业抱负，以及他们参与课程时涉及的任何特殊限制或问题。 我尝试尽可能灵活：例如，仔细考虑我的材料并针对残疾学生进行相应修改，或者以多种风格（讲座、小组作业等）进行教学，以适应不同的学习需求。 我鼓励学生来我的办公时间，这样我就可以单独会见他们。 通过热情、开放、友好和幽默，我在课堂内外创造了一个温暖、开放和安全的环境。 这样的环境让学生能够自由交流、感到受到尊重、承担智力风险并安全地质疑他们的假设。 为了进一步营造一个真正包容的学习环境，我相信学生也有必要将彼此和我视为“整体”，而不是各个部分的总和：“亚洲人”、“男性”、“异性恋”、“非洲人” 美国人”、“学生”、“女性”、“老师”。 因此，我经常使用小组和结对工作来促进学生之间的互动，并有策略地利用讨论和活动来强调我们集体生活经历的普遍性和多样性。 最后，从课程一开始，我就向我的学生明确表示，在评估他们是否成功实现该特定课程的目标时，我考虑的不仅仅是各种机械“部分”的总和（例如，论文成绩）； 相反，我也会将个人作为一个整体进行反思，特别关注整个过程中的努力和进步。

Furthermore, I am mindful of my growth as a teacher as I consider the "big picture" of my own teaching. In addition to teaching Introduction to Developmental Psychology, I have had the benefit of teaching a research methods course for three semesters. Thus, I have been able to reflect on what works and what doesn't from semester to semester. For example, based on student feedback, I have increased the use of visual aids in my classroom, such as Power Point presentations, and have attempted to keep groups of students relatively small (2- 4). My future goals as a teacher also reflect the importance I place on the big picture. Specifically, I hope to one day develop a course with a community service component, in which my students are encouraged to interact with a variety of populations (such as young children or elderly individuals). This will make studying psychology and human development more personal and meaningful for the students, and will emphasize the role that psychologists can play in the larger world. Although only a small percentage of my students will pursue a career in psychology, I hope that for all of my students, the skills developed, the relationships created, and the assumptions questioned in my classes become integral parts of the "whole" of their lives. 此外，当我考虑自己教学的“大局”时，我也关注自己作为一名教师的成长。 除了教授发展心理学概论之外，我还教授了三个学期的研究方法课程。 因此，我能够从一个学期到另一个学期反思什么有效，什么无效。 例如，根据学生的反馈，我在课堂上增加了视觉教具的使用，例如 Power Point 演示文稿，并尝试使学生小组保持相对较小的规模 (2-4)。 我作为一名教师的未来目标也反映了我对大局的重视。 具体来说，我希望有一天能够开发一门包含社区服务内容的课程，鼓励我的学生与各种人群（例如幼儿或老年人）互动。 这将使心理学和人类发展的研究对学生来说更加个性化和有意义，并将强调心理学家在更广阔的世界中可以发挥的作用。 虽然我的学生中只有一小部分会从事心理学职业，但我希望对于我所有的学生来说，在我的课堂上培养的技能、建立的关系以及质疑的假设成为他们生活“整体”不可或缺的一部分 。

- [Diversity statements: what to avoid and what to include](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/campus/diversity-statements-what-avoid-and-what-include)
	- What to ==avoid==
		-   **Diversity by proxy** 
			- Diversity by proxy is when candidates borrow from the success of others, an organisation or programme. Candidates speak specifically about their department’s student demographics or a programme for students of colour that they direct, are part of or appreciate.
				- Example 1: “\_\_\_\_\_ (university’s name) is one of the most diverse campuses in the country. We are \_\_\_\_% white, \_\_\_\_% Latin, \_\_\_\_% Asian/Pacific Islander, \_\_\_\_% African American.”
				- Example 2: Candidates might mention success and claim some responsibility, implicitly or explicitly. “I’m a faculty mentor for the McNair Scholars programme and we have had wonderful, bright students who just need intense mentorship.”
				- Example 3: The message of “I support success for people of colour” can be followed by surprise and self-congratulation. “We have students who do very well, one or two have even gone on to graduate school at very good schools! One of my students, from Chicago, a first-generation student from a single-parent household, is a first-year PhD student at Berkeley.”
			- We called this “diversity by proxy” because the candidate’s example relies on numbers that tell us about where they are and not who they are or what they have done. Secondly, they are borrowing identity, status and achievement by linking themselves to the success stories of students of colour or faculty. In this way, they give undue credit to themselves as a saviour.
		-   **Personal stories of redemption**
			- Candidates write of personal experiences that have occurred outside of the academy and are meant to reflect their appreciation for diversity and inclusion and their dissatisfaction with racism.
				- Example 1: They may write about an event that solidified their understanding of privilege: “I grew up in a small town where there was only one Indian family and one of the girls from that family became a close friend. And then, in the sixth grade, everything changed. She and I both auditioned for the school play, *Annie*, and it was clear that another girl got the lead because she was white and looked the part. But my friend was clearly better than everyone else. I felt bad for her but there was nothing I could do. And that is why I really feel so strongly about racism and exclusion and do what I can to help students of colour.”
				- Example 2: They may also talk about how they work with and learn so much from their colleagues of colour and students of colour. The focus is on their feeling and how they assuage their feelings of social injustice by their engagement, but does this lead to fighting structural issues found in the academy?
			- The playing field is never level, and so what do they do for those who they do not deem “clearly better”? 
		-  **The exceptionalist argument**
			- Candidates write that they are in favour of diversity and inclusion but have not been in a position to fight against exclusionary practices.
				- Example 1: “Diversity is important but I can’t do it because my discipline is based on dead white men.”
				- Example 2: Or “I believe in diversity, but I have not been in a leadership position where I might make decisions. I would be supportive if there were some people of colour.”
			- The exceptionalist argument suggests that impact can only be made from certain positions, thereby exonerating most people who do not go against the grain. This obscures the roles that all faculty play in maintaining the status quo and contributing in small and large ways to discriminatory practices and negative outcomes for faculty, staff and students of colour.
			- Bias can lead to mis-assessing students, even creating unequal learning conditions. A student may be characterised as “low achieving” when they may need greater encouragement or when they come from a high school with fewer resources. In committee work, colleagues may use different adjectives to describe the quality of work of women colleagues and colleagues of colour.  
	- What to include
		- Diversity as a **strategy**
			- Creating a *plan*, rather than simply doing an action, moves people beyond reacting and shows an understanding of intersectionality and the matrices of oppression.
			- For online teachers, it is especially important to consider the contours of their students’ lives. The strongest statements are ones where they see that there are interlocking issues – *food insecurity* is connected to student learning, impression management with professors, matriculation入学考试 and well-being. For example, an online teaching candidate may have buttressed student support with financial and social support and mentoring and even made changes to policies that *excluded* certain people or groups based on *criteria that are unnecessary*. The strongest statements are those where candidates articulate how *diversity is used centrally in re-thinking budget, curriculum and access*.
		- Evidence of addressing **structural challenges**
			- Strong diversity statements include examples of candidates advocating for structural changes. They show that they recognise and make systemic changes to address this. Candidates can write about “white space” and how they have educated others and *implemented new practices* that go against the status quo. They may have found systemic holes and problems that have disparate effects on women of colour. They may have counteracted systemic and institutionalised practices. For instance, strong candidates mention noticing varying language, such as different adjectives, in the evaluations of faculty, staff and students of colour. 
		- Recognition and **underscoring** of the **invisible labour** done by faculty and staff of colour
			- Supporting faculty and staff of colour must be multifaceted. It is widely known and acknowledged that faculty of colour have different experiences – they are counted on to take on certain services because they are a person of colour; students of colour look to them more than to white colleagues; and they face student racism. 
		- Demonstrated enlightened mentoring. 
			- Mentors who are “woke” to and address structural challenges, who use diversity as a strategy, and who recognise or underscore the invisible labour and challenges of faculty, staff and students of colour will mentor in ways that have longer term impacts and that mitigate exclusion and discriminatory practices.  Mentoring is especially difficult in the online world, but candidates who write about ways they have overcome this demonstrate strong commitments to the work of the framework we call JEDI (justice, equity, diversity and inclusion).
			- The JEDI framework is about more than one or two actions, and goes beyond a checklist. Thus, posting a diversity statement online is, in and of itself, not “enough”. However, this is an important part of systemic change when faculty post diversity statements, and these become an integral part of performance reviews and promotion. We are elevating the importance of JEDI work, and taking a step in the right direction of the structural changes needed for social transformation.
- [Developing and Writing a Diversity Statement](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/developing-and-writing-a-diversity-statement/)
	- Research and Scholarship
		-   Does your research/scholarship directly address issues of diversity, inclusion, or equity? If so, how?
		-   Does your research/scholarship address issues specific to marginalized groups? If so, describe the connection.
		-   Has your research/scholarship been shared with the community or public in a way that promotes access to scholarship?
		-   Has your scholarship involved collaboration with diverse groups of colleagues or commentators?
	- Mentorship and Advising
		-   Have you worked with any students in a mentorship or advisory capacity who are from marginalized groups? If so, how did you help them identify and overcome barriers to success? Think about your experience with research mentorship, teaching or tutoring, academic advising, and community mentorship.
		-   If you plan to train undergraduates and/or graduate students in your future role, what efforts will you make to recruit and retain students from marginalized and underrepresented groups?
	- Teaching
		-   How do you plan to serve a student body that is diverse in a multitude of ways? Think not just race, ethnicity, and SES, but about age, religion, academic preparedness, disability, gender expression, or other differences.
		-   How does your approach to course design take into account considerations of diversity? You may wish to reflect on using a range of assessments, preventing bias in grading, diversifying course content, using inclusive language in the syllabus and classroom, or utilizing student feedback to improve classroom culture or tone. Try to generate at least one specific example of how your decision affects student’s learning in your course. (Note: One prominent example of inclusive syllabus language is diversity statements within syllabi; see examples from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements), [Yale Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.yale.edu/DiversityStatements), and The Eberly Center at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/syllabus/checklist/diversitystatement.html))
		-   What do you do as a teacher that creates a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere? How do you ensure that students in your class feel a sense of belonging?
		-   How does your approach to facilitating discussion (and/or structuring active learning activities) take into account considerations of positionality, power, and/or diversity? You may wish to reflect on using semi-structured discussion techniques, online access points for student participation, classroom seating arrangements, or other ways in which you create opportunities for student engagement. Try to generate at least one specific example of how your pedagogical choice facilitates student engagement in a particular course.
		-   Does your discipline lend itself to dialogue about diversity? If so, how do you incorporate this dialogue into your courses? Describe the impact of doing so on student learning and engagement.
			-   How do you ensure that your course readings and sources reflect diverse perspectives? Have you had any experience diversifying/decolonizing content for your courses, and if so, what has been the impact on student learning?
	- Service
		-   Have you participated in any service activities (e.g. university committees, symposiums, workshops, volunteer work in the community) whose goals relate to diversity, inclusion, and equity? If so, describe your experience. What did you accomplish? What did you learn? What skills did you build in the process?
		-   If you have engaged in diversity-related service, how will you incorporate your experience into the job for which you are applying? (Note: here is where – having done your research on the school to which you are applying – you might consider referencing an existing diversity-related initiative to which you could contribute or which you could expand)

## Teaching Statement
- [ ] role of teacher in the learning goal: help construct the safe environment. help student find their motivation and settle their own goal based on their different background, help student to format the positive and motivated learning loop
- [ ] role of teacher in the student self-learning goal. help dissect the knowledge blueprint. Realize the existed big picture in this area and introduce each of them. Identify the core resources for each of them. for example, if student is interested in the R language, i will introduce data camp to them. if students is interested in the machine learning, i will introduce udemy A-Z (Machine Learning) online course to them. I will also teach some core difficult concept first to make their self-learning easier. I am inspired from Dr. Nicalos Eaton's "Structual Equation Modeling" class where his speed is super slow, repeated the construct/ latent variable again and again. He spend half of the semester to talk about the eigen value and eigen vector. After leaning those definition detailed, i realized i can self-learning the principle component and factor analysis quickly without his teaching. I believe each area has such diffcult to hurdle students' self-learning. Each student may have some variability and similarity in this difficult. I will help them resolve the common difficult in the class and personalize the solution for each student if they are eager to self-learning some knowledge beyond the course design.
