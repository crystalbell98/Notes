- The observation of survival time has two components that must be unambiguously defined: a *beginning point* (i.e., when the "clock starts") and an *endpoint* that is reached when the event of interest occurs (i.e., when the "clock stops").  
	- Begin Point:  In a randomized clinical trial, observation of survival time usually begins on the day a subject is randomized to receive one of the treatment protocols. In an occupational exposure study, t = 0 may be the day a subject began work at a particular plant. 
	- End Point: The date of discharge from the hospital or the actual moment that the MI occurred. Observation may end at the time when a subject literally "dies" from the disease of interest, or it may end upon the occurrence of some other non-fatal, well-defined, condition such as meeting clinical criteria for remission of a cancer. The survival time is the distance on the time scale between these two points. 
- Two mechanisms can lead to incomplete observation of time: *censoring and truncation*. 
	- A censored observation is one whose value is incomplete due to factors that are random for each subject. A truncated observation is incomplete due to a selection process inherent in the study design. The most commonly encountered form of a censored observation is one where observation begins at the defined time t = 0 and *terminates before the outcome of interest is observed*. Because the incomplete nature of the observation occurs in the right tail of the time axis, such observations are said to be **right censored**.  In a study where right censoring is the only type of censoring possible, observation on subjects may begin at the same time or at varying times. the WHAS study, patients may enter the study over several years. As we see in Table I. I, subject 2 entered the study on January 14, 1995, while subject 50 entered on July 17, 1997. In this type of study, regardless of calendar time, each subject's time of enrollment is assumed to define the t = 0 point. For obvious practical reasons, all studies have a point when observation ends on all subjects; therefore subjects entering at different times will have variable lengths of maximum follow-up time. Incomplete observation of a survival time due to the end of the study or follow-up is considered a right censored observation because the process by which subjects entered the study is random at the subject level. 
	- In some studies, there may be a clear definition of the beginning time point; but subjects may not come under actual observation until after this point has passed. For example, in modeling age at menarche, suppose we *define the zero value of time as 8 years*. Suppose a subject enters the study at age 10, still not having experienced menarche. We know that this subject could have experienced menarche after age 8 but, due to the study design, was *not enrolled in the study until age 10*. This subject would not enter the analysis until time 10. This type of incomplete observation of time is called **left truncation** or delayed entry. Another example would be to study survival time in the WHAS among those discharged from the hospital alive. Here subjects stay in the hospital for varying lengths of time but we do not begin to study them until they "leave the front door." 
	- Another censoring mechanism that sometimes occurs in practice is **left censoring**. An observation is left censored if the *event of interest has already occurred when observation begins*. For example, in the study of age at menarche, if a subject enrolls in the study at age 10 and has already experienced menarche, this subject's time is left censored. In the WHAS study, if we begin observation at seven days post admission then subjects who die in the first week are left censored. 
	- A less common form of incomplete observation occurs when the *entire study population* has *experienced the event of interest before the study begins* (i.e., subjects have been selected because they have experienced the event of interest). This is sometimes referred to as length biased sampling and it must be accounted for in the analysis. An example would be a study of risk factors for time to diagnosis of colorectal cancer among subjects in a cancer registry with this diagnosis. In this study, being in the cancer registry represents a selection process assuring that time to the event is known for each subject. This type of incomplete observation of time is called **right truncation**. Because this type of data occurs relatively infrequently in practice, we do not consider it further in this text. Readers interested in learning more about the analysis of right truncated data are referred to Klein and Moeschberger (2003). 
	- In some practical settings, one may not be able to observe time continuously. For example, in a study of educational interventions to prevent IV drug use, the protocol may specify that subjects, after completion of their "treatment," will be *contacted every 3 months* for a period of 2 years. In this study, the outcome might be time of first relapse to IV drug use. Because subjects are contacted every 3 months, time is only accurately measured to multiples of 3 months. Given the discrete nature of the observed time variable, it would be *inappropriate* to use a statistical model that assumed the *observed values of time were continuous*. Thus, if a subject reports at the 12-month follow-up that she has returned to drug use, we know only that her time is between 9 and 12 months. Data of this type are said to be **interval censored**.
- Functions
	- The cumulative distribution function of the random variable survival time, denoted T, is the probability that a subject selected at random will have a survival time less than or equal some stated value, t. This is denoted as F(t) = Pr(*T ≤ t*).
	- The *survival function* is the probability of observing a survival time greater than some stated value t, denoted S(t)= Pr(*T > t*). Note that the sum of the two functions is 1.0 at any value of t (i.e., S(t)=1-F(t)).

	- ⾸先是PDF，概率密度函数，确定分布形状（正态，卡⽅），不是概率值=不能⽐较具体值出现概率（两点之间可以有⽆限个数值，具体数值出现 的频率约等于0），可以⽐较两点附近值出现概率（研究对象变成⼀个区间，就可以积分得概率），是CDF的导数。PDF曲线下⾯积为 ，其积分 为区间的概率。CDF的值是PDF的曲线下⾯积=区间概率。*离散变量的PDF*也叫probability mass function, 区间的概率做为点概率. 其次是Survival函数 S(x)，代表probability surviving beyond x, 所以是1-CDF。*hazard function, instantaneous failure rate, 所以是 PDF/S(x), 要想死亡得先活着*。
- Kaplan-Meier estimator
	- The Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function also called the product limit estimator, is the default estimator used by most software packages. This estimator incorporates information from all the observations available, both uncensored (event times) and censored, by considering survival to any point in time as a series of steps defined at the observed survival and censored times. We use the observed data to estimate the conditional probability of confirmed survival at each observed survival time and then multiply them to obtain an estimate of the overall survival function.
	- we denote the number of deaths observed at the first failure time as d¡. In this_ more general notation, the estimated probability of dying in the small interval around 6 is d1/n1 and the estimated probability of surviving is (n1 -d1)/n1.
	- No other failure times (deaths) were observed, hence the estimated conditional probability of survival through small intervals about every time point in the interval is 1.0.
