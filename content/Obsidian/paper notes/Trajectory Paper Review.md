## Definition 
- There are several types of **psychotic disorders**, including:
	- *Schizophrenia*: A chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may experience delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and cognitive deficits.
	- *Schizoaffective disorder*: A condition in which a person has symptoms of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder, such as depression or bipolar disorder. The symptoms may occur simultaneously or at different times.
	- *Brief psychotic disorder*: A short-term mental health condition that involves sudden onset of psychotic symptoms, which typically resolve within a month.
	-  *Delusional disorder*: A condition characterized by persistent and non-bizarre delusions (false beliefs) that are not accompanied by other psychotic symptoms like hallucinations.
	- *Substance-induced psychotic disorder*: Psychotic symptoms that are directly related to the use of a substance, such as drugs or alcohol, or withdrawal from a substance.
	- *Psychotic disorder due to a medical condition*: Psychotic symptoms that are directly related to a physical illness or medical condition, such as a brain tumor or an endocrine disorder.
- Psychotic disorders are a category of **mental health disorders**. Term "psychotic disorder" inherently implies the presence of psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. However, a person can have a mental health disorder that is not a psychotic disorder and does not involve psychosis. For example, *mood disorders like depression and bipolar disorder*, *anxiety disorders* like generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder, and *personality disorders* like borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder are all mental health conditions that do not fall under the category of psychotic disorders. While some of these disorders may have symptoms that overlap with those of psychotic disorders, they do not include the core psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions that define psychotic disorders. In some cases, a person with a mood disorder, such as bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, may experience a psychotic episode during a severe mood episode (mania or depression). In these cases, the term "*mood disorder with psychotic features*" is used to describe the presence of psychotic symptoms in the context of a mood disorder. It's essential to receive a thorough assessment and diagnosis from a mental health professional to ensure appropriate treatment and support. 
- **Bipolar disorder** is not classified as a psychotic disorder; it is a mood disorder. However, it is essential to note that people with bipolar disorder can experience psychotic symptoms during severe mood episodes. Bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, is characterized by alternating periods of elevated mood (mania or hypomania) and depressive episodes. The primary features of bipolar disorder include significant changes in mood, energy levels, and activity, which can affect a person's ability to function in daily life. While bipolar disorder is primarily a mood disorder, individuals with this condition may experience psychotic symptoms during severe manic or depressive episodes. These symptoms can include hallucinations (perceiving things that aren't there) and delusions (holding false beliefs despite evidence to the contrary). When a person with bipolar disorder experiences psychotic symptoms, the condition is referred to as "bipolar disorder with psychotic features."
- **Psychotic experiences**, also known as psychotic symptoms, refer to individual experiences that involve a distortion or loss of contact with reality. They are the primary symptoms of psychotic disorders but can also occur in other mental health conditions or even in individuals without a diagnosed mental health disorder. The main types of psychotic experiences include:
	-   Hallucinations: Sensory experiences that occur without an external stimulus, such as hearing voices, seeing things that aren't there, or feeling sensations on the skin when nothing is touching it.
	-   Delusions: Strongly held false beliefs that are not supported by evidence and persist despite contradictory information. Delusions can be persecutory, grandiose, or referential, among other types.
	-   Disorganized thinking: Difficulty organizing thoughts or expressing them coherently, often resulting in confused, fragmented, or illogical speech.
	-   Abnormal motor behavior: Unusual or disorganized behavior, such as agitation, catatonia, or bizarre postures and movements.激动、紧张症或奇怪的姿势和动作
- **IQ**
	-  Full-Scale IQ: This score represents an individual's overall cognitive abilities, combining the results from both verbal and nonverbal subtests. It provides a general estimate of a person's intellectual functioning compared to others in their age group. Full-Scale IQ is often used as a summary of an individual's intellectual capacity.
	-  Verbal IQ: This score measures a person's verbal abilities, which include language skills, vocabulary, comprehension, and verbal reasoning. Verbal IQ tests typically consist of tasks that assess an individual's understanding and use of language, such as defining words, answering questions based on passages, and solving verbal analogies.
	- Nonverbal IQ (or Performance IQ): This score measures a person's nonverbal cognitive abilities, including spatial reasoning, visual-motor skills, pattern recognition, and problem-solving. Nonverbal IQ tests usually consist of tasks that do not require verbal responses and instead involve manipulating objects, identifying patterns, and solving puzzles.
- **SZ onset age**
	- For men, the onset of schizophrenia usually occurs between the ages of 16 and 25. Men tend to experience an earlier onset, with a peak around the early 20s.
	- For women, the onset of schizophrenia generally occurs slightly later, between the ages of 25 and 30, with a peak in the late 20s.
- **IQ** tests typically assess several of these **cognitive functions** to derive a Full-Scale IQ score, which provides a general estimate of an individual's overall intellectual functioning. However, it is crucial to recognize that IQ scores do not capture the full range of an individual's cognitive abilities or potential. Additionally, individuals may have strengths and weaknesses in different cognitive domains, which may not be fully reflected in their overall IQ score. Therefore, it is essential to consider specific cognitive functions alongside IQ scores to gain a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's cognitive profile.

## Paper Summary

1. [A longitudinal study on the relationship between duration of untreated psychosis and executive function in early-onset ﬁrst-episode psychosis](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/cog%20trajectory%20in%20SZ/A%20longitudinal%20study%20on%20the%20relationship%20between%20duration%20of%20untreated%20psychosis%20and%20executive%20function%20in%20early-onset%20first-episode%20psychosis.pdf) 
	- #cog_predict #cog_DUP #cog_symptom David Fraguas 2014, *2-year*, N=66
		-  Existed
			- cross-sectional find that shorter DUP associated with better cognitive outcome while other cross-sectional and longitudinal failed to find such a relationship.
		- Gap
			- No study assessed between DUP and changes in cognition in early-onset psychosis
		- Objective
			- DUP and executive function in early onset (first psychotic symptom before 18 years old) first episode patients
		- Results
			- The multivariate stepwise linear regression models (DUP and EF were rank-transformed) showed that *DUP and baseline negative symptoms* were the only significant *predictors of change in executive function*. IQ was controlled by using the residuals from the regression models.
		- Limitation
			- DUP was measured by positive symptoms rather than negative. no consensus on executive function measures (which domain is better).
2. [Brain structure, cognition, and brain age in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and healthy controls](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/cog%20trajectory%20in%20SZ/Brain%20structure,%20cognition,%20and%20brain%20age%20in%20schizophrenia,%20bipolar%20disorder,%20and%20healthy%20controls.pdf) 
	- #cog_brain_biomarker 
		- 91 healthy controls, 81 SZ, 53 euthymic BD
		- *SZ* had *lower cortical thickness* and *fractional anisotropy* **compared** with *BD or healthy controls*, and most prominent in fronto-temporal circuitry, and more evident in younger participants. *Brain change* was *associated* with *cognitive* performance *independent of diagnosis*. predicted age was 8 years greater than chronological age in SZ and was not different in BD.
3. [Cognitive Decline and Disrupted Cognitive Trajectory in Schizophrenia](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/cog%20trajectory%20in%20SZ/Cognitive%20Decline%20and%20Disrupted%20Cognitive%20Trajectory%20in%20Schizophrenia.pdf) 
	- #cog_brain_biomarker
		- SZ is defined by weak associated symptoms and the most devastating symptoms such as cognitive impairment and amotivation are present in segments of healthy general population.
		- SZ subtype studies based on phenomenology found no replicable biological distinctions among them because that most patients meet criteria for different cross-sectional subtypes at various points in their lives.
		- magnitude of cognitive decline and the phase of illness during which it occurs may be a more useful approach.
		- SZ demonstrated *cognitive decline* from estimated premorbid IQ, representing about half of all patients, have been reported to have a variety of *brain structure abnormalities* compared with those patients whose premorbid IQ and current cognitive performance are consistent with healthy controls.

	- #cog_etiology Robert A. McCutcheon 2023 **Review**
		1. Cognitive impairment clinical present and **natural history**: *distinct* from positive and negative *symptoms*. *Disorganization* factor shows the strongest association with cognitive.
		2. **Global or domain**: Composite score, global,  are more extreme than constituent parts. some study indicates that *processing speed* is the domain most affected. Now, cognitive impairments are *best conceptualized as* a *generalized deficit*.
		3. **Variation**
			1. Variation **between** individuals. heterogeneity in the magnitude of the impairment. *not clear whether* it is *due to* variations in *premorbid* cognitive ability.
			2. Variation **within** individuals. *greater* intra-individual variability *in SZ* than controls. impairments in different domains, need more prospective studies.
		4. **Course**: deficit *occur* in *childhood* (before first symptom onset). *Continue decline* (evidence mixed in long-term longitudinal studies)
			1. meta analyses of longitudinal studies showed improvement. However, many of the studies are *short-term* and the improvements are likely artifacts of *practice effects* with *less* *improvement* in patients than in controls
			2. *long-term* showed *improvement* [50] and *decline* [51, 52]
				1. shortages: lack of controls, small sample sizes. poor matching to controls
				2. unclear whether reflect normal cognitive trajectories, or changing magnitude of impairment.
		5. compared with **other psychiatric disorders**?
			1. patterns of deficit are different across psychiatric disorders
			2. SZ is more severe
			3. SZ present before the expression of symptoms, which is not the case for bipolar disorder or depression
		6. **correlations** between **subjective reports** of cognitive impairment **and objective measures** of cognitive performance: weak association.
			1. high risk of psychosis individuals reported a greater severity of subjective impairment than people with SZ despite having a less degree of impairment on objective testing. lack of insight and high disorganized symptoms contribute to a poor ability to self-assess cognitive abilities.
			2. individuals with subjective impairments appear to be more willing to engage in therapy, whereas those with more severe objective impairments may not see the need.
		7. **Functional consequences**: *direct correlation* between cognitive performance and *real-world functioning*. [24, 76]
			1. *stronger* when functioning is assessed using *performance-based* measures compared to interview-based assessment
			2. cognitive impairment is linked to reduced *adherence to treatment*, a greater likelihood of *hospitalization admission*, longer *hospital stay*
			3. cognitive impairment and negative symptoms are major factor in losing productivity
			4. *stronger* correlation *in SZ* compared to controls. Non-linear relationship between cognition and function
		8. **etiology**
			1. **Genetics** factor
				1. GWAS: 
					1. *negative* correlation between *SZ PRS* and cognition | ( liability for SZ). high SZ GWAS related with low cog in healthy population
					2. this negative is minimum or *absent* in for *BP PRS* and cognition in BP patients
					3. low *cognition PRS* associated with increased risk of SZ
					4. in *SZ patients*, *cognition* related with *IQ PRS*, *education* attainment *PRS*, but *not SZ PRS* [95, 100]
						1. cognitive impairment is not a consequence of genetic liability for the disorder, **may a mediating factor through which genetic risk exerts its effects**
					5. in healthy controls, SZ PRS negatively correlated with cognition at baseline, no association with cognitive decline, implicating neurodevelopment rather than neurodegenerative process
					6. GWAS analyses account for 10% of risk variance and only in European ancestry
				2. *cognitive* function appears to be *one phenotypic component* that *reflects genetics differences* 
			2. **Environmental factors**: ethnic minority, socioeconomic disadvantages ,obstetric complications, growing up in an urban environment, acute cannabis use but not occasional cannabis use.

		-  Existed: 
			- premorbid 8 IQ, and first episode 14 IQ deficit. different premorbid trajectory across cognitive functions. static verbal deficits. slower growth in processing speed and working memory.
		- Gap:
			1. *when* deficit *emerge* (specific developmental period?): mixed results when studying early childhood and late adolescence
			2. whether *subclinical psychotic experience* has normal development: cross-sectional showed greater deficits in processing speed, memory, working memory who transited. few, short follow up longitudinal study showed moderate deficit in subclinical psychotic experience compared with first episode patients
			3. *specific* to SZ? has been identified in various psychiatric disorders,  but course different between disorders. depression and BP have milder deficits than SZ. Or even higher average in BP
		- Sample
			- population-representative longitudinal study, Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children ALSPAC, IQ change from 18 month to 20 years old, 1) psychotic disorder, 2) psychosis with depression, 3) subclinical psychotic experiences, and 4) depression were compared with 5) controls.
				- ![[Pasted image 20230503145354.png|600]]
		- Results:
			1. *psychotic disorder* continually *increasing deficits* 18m to 20yr in *full IQ* 1.09SD and *nonverbal IQ* 0.94SD
			2. depression continually increasing deficits 18m to 20yr in nonverbal 0.29SD
			3. 8-20yr, *psychotic disorder* showed *slower growth* in processing speed, working memory, attention. *static deficit* in language, visuospatial.
			4. *weak evidence* of deficit in *pscychosis with depression* and *psychotic experiences*

			- meta-analysis showed premorbid decline is 8 IQ points, first episode decline is 14 IQ points, 15-21 points in chronic. Course of cog in SZ is *mixed*: 1) stablization of cog deficits, 2) amelioration 改善 of function. 
			1. Stirling et al. (2003)(13) **24 FE** patients *10.6 years* *Decline* in performance on three out of nine tests: object assembly, picture completion, and memory for design. *Stable* performance on measures of executive/frontal function.
			2. Hoff et al. (2005)(15) **21 FE** patients **8 healthy** controls *10 years* High *stability* on most neuropsychological tests; *Improvement* in Verbal IQ, Stroop  Color Word and Finger Tapping in both patients and controls; Greater improvement in patients compared to controls in Visual Reproduction-Immediate.
			3. Leeson et al. (2009)(26) **31 FE** patients *6 years*  Patients showed *deterioration* in attentional set shifting task performance from baseline to 1 year, but no difference between baseline and 3 or 6 years; Controls showed no change over time.
			4. Albus et al. (2006)(17) **71 FE** patients **71 healthy** controls *5 years*  Both groups showed *stability* or *improvement* in the majority of cognitive domains.

		- Gap: 
			1. clinical samples not represent SZ pop
			2. short follow up time
			3. most do not have controls
			4. not consider anti-psychotic medication (it may contribute to severity of cog decline)
		- Objective: 
			1. whether SZ has cog decline (Yes), 
			2. whether this SZ decline same across cog domain (Not same, *decline* in IQ, verbal knowledge, and memory. *stable* deficit in executive function, processing speed impairment after first episode. magnitude varies),

		- Prediction related
			- SZ: IQ decline not attenuated when adjusted for educ, race, sex, age at baseline.
			- SZ: Antipsychotic medication duration does not impact decline
			- SZ: baseline symptom severity related with greater decline, but change of symptom severity does not associated with IQ change

		-  Existed: default is EOS evidence
			 - EOS, ==early-onset SZ disorders (EOS)==, illness onset before 18 years old, 5% of the SZ population, worse outcome, similar cognitive profile to adult-onset SZ
			 - Cognitive deficits, core feature of SZ, not appear in all SZ cases, and more pronounced in SZ than BP, affect all cog domains, effect size from moderate to large, consistent over decades.
			 - most longitudinal studies found stable course
			 1. Symptoms
				 - *divergent* evidence on association between psychotic *symptoms and cognition* at baseline and longitudinally
					 - negative symptoms interact with cognition to a greater extent than positive symptoms
					 - negative symptoms mediate the relationship between cognition and functioning
					 - reduction in positive symptoms correlated with cognitive improvement
				 - adult sample, stable remission in the first year predict a better cognitive course
			2. Duration of illness
				 - adult sample, shorter *DUP, duration of untreated psychosis*, leads to a better cog. But majority of studies report no such association.
				 - EOS, baseline study found no effect of illness duration on cog, while another longitudinal found shorter illness duration associated with greater improvement in executive function.
				 - EOS, majority reported no association between DUP and cognitive course.
				 - possibly worse impact of DUP on cog in EOS compared to AOS
			3. Suicide
				- depression and insight is important predictor of commit suicide
				- higher cognitive function correlated with suicide attempt history, while others find no such association
		- Gap:
			 - course of global cog over the first years has yet to be reported in EOS
			 - to what extent the course of cognition is influenced by clinical characteristics in the early illness period
			 - remission and cognition has yet to be investigated in EOS
		- Objective
			- investigate to what extent the cognitive course in EOS is influenced by clinical characteristics during the early illness period, such as symptoms of schizophrenia, DUP, remission, suicide attempts, and number and duration of hospitalizations caused by psychosis.
		- Sample
			- 31 patients and 73 healthy controls. baseline, year 1, and year 2.
		- Results
			- cognitive impairment is *stable* over the first years of EOS. Not detected relationship between DUP, remission, positive/negative symptoms, and hospitalization on the one hand, and long-term cognition on longitudinal cognitive function. But *general symptoms* predicted and *suicide attempt history* predicted a deteriorated cognition course (one interaction predictor* time at a time)

			- **Course**
				 1. *short*-term evidence showed *stable* cognitive dysfunction or *improving*
				 2. *long*-term evidence is *limited* and some *stable*, some *declines*
					 1. only one study beyond 10-year follow up: improved initially and showed no decline thereafter. However, the sample is young, mean age is 43 years at 20-year follow.
					 2. some studies found decline in older people with SZ. These decline might limited to institutionalized populations
			- **Heterogeneity** across psychosis: cross-sectional study showed that deficits in BP and depression, and worsen in SZ
			- **Clinical Significance**: 
				 1. deficit leads to negative *symptom* and impairs daily *functioning*
				 2. decline unrelated to change of symptom
				 3. decline correlated with increase in symptoms

				- social function change and cognitive change become *non-significant* after *controlling for symptoms*
				- medium to *large association* between *increased symptoms and decreased social functioning*
			- vocation status:

			 - *controls* performed better on all cognitive tests. These *differences were larger in older* participants for verbal knowledge, verbal fluency, and abstract-executive function.

		- Discussion
			 1. **general population**, most cognitive function are *stable* or improve *until age 50* years. *Processing speed is exception* as it decreases across adulthood. our sample showed faster decline in executive function and immediate verbal memory than national cohort.
			 2. **SZ**: *accelerated cognitive aging* in older individuals, consistent with previous findings, and evidence that accelerated aging of neural functions, health, mobility, and premature mortality in SZ
				 - 这里，我不懂 加速 衰老，指的是 提前发生 下降， 还是发生后的下降速度。如果正常人不下降，SZ下降，那么随着年龄增长的差距 并不能说明 下降速度的变化
			3. *discrepancy* with *another* study, more longitudinal study is needed.
				- Other study suggest accelerated aging in memory and verbal knowledge, not executive function or fluency.
				- discrepancy may be sampling methods, cognitive measures, follow-up duration, control group.

		- **Similarity in Treatment Response**: Across the 24 months, both groups showed similar responses in terms of symptom reduction. There were no significant group-by-time interactions for any measured outcomes, indicating that cannabis use did not worsen symptoms over time.
		- **Relapse Rates**: Despite similar symptom reduction, cannabis users had higher rates of relapse as defined by the study's criteria.
		- **Impact of Ongoing Cannabis Use**: Frequent cannabis use, confirmed by positive urine toxicology tests, was a predictor of relapse. This suggests a dose-related risk of relapse with continued cannabis use, potentially by lowering the threshold for psychotic episodes.

		- **Cognitive Deficits in Psychotic Disorders**: Cognitive impairments are a core feature of psychotic disorders, significantly affecting functional outcomes, treatment adherence, and relapse risk.
		- **Prevalence of Cannabis Use Disorders**: The median lifetime prevalence of cannabis use disorder in patients with schizophrenia is notably higher (27.1%) than in the general population.
		- **Cannabis as a Risk Factor**: Cannabis use is identified as a risk factor for the development of psychosis.
		- **Cognitive Impairments in Healthy Individuals**: Both acute and long-term cannabis use have been linked to cognitive impairments in healthy subjects. Persistent cannabis use, especially starting in adolescence, has been associated with a global cognitive decline and lower IQ.
		- **Contradictory Findings in Psychotic Patients**: Surprisingly, research indicates that psychotic patients who use cannabis tend to show improved cognitive performance compared to non-using psychotic patients.
			- The effects of long-term cannabis use on cognition depend on several factors, such as, the continuity of cannabis use over time, the amount and frequency of use, the age at consumption onset and, of course, the premorbid cognitive functioning of the patient.
			- research on the relationship between psychotic illness and cognitive performance points to better cognitive functioning in cannabis-using patients, compared with those who do not present comorbid use
			- In addition, *higher frequency* of use and *younger age at onset* have been associated with *higher cognitive functioning*
			- *Most longitudinal studies* have reported *better cognitive functioning* in cannabis using patients, both in short follow-up periods (Rodríguez-Sánchez et al., 2010) and in long-term follow-up periods (Stirling, Lewis, Hop- kins, & White, 2005).
			- In contrast, we also followed a group of patients with a psychosis spectrum disorder and one of their siblings, over 10 years, and did *not find a relationship* between longitudinal patterns of cannabis use and cognitive outcomes in the patient group. Further, patients reporting *longitudinal cannabis use* showed *poorer social cognition*, and the combination of low premorbid IQ, current cannabis use, and earlier age at illness onset resulted in worse performance in the working memory domain (Sánchez-Torres et al., 2013).
			- Methodological variability in studies approaching the relationships between cannabis use and cognition in psychosis must be taken into account when interpreting the results. Factors, such as, sample size, diagnostic groups included, instruments used to assess drug use, and parameters associated with consumption, such as time since onset of consumption, frequency, and recency, should be taken into account when considering the effects of cannabis on cognition.
			- Ringen et al. (2010) reported *differential associations* between cannabis and cognition in patients with *schizophrenia* and *bipolar disorders*. While schizophrenic patients who used cannabis underperformed nonusers in attention, executive functioning, and verbal memory measures, bi- polar cannabis-using patients showed better verbal fluency than those patients who did not use cannabis.
			- Rabin, Zakzanis, Daskalakis, and George (2013) also explored *cumulative cannabis exposure* and cognitive performance. They found an association between more years of cannabis exposure and *poorer* performance in tasks of attention, verbal and visual learning, and executive functions in patients with current cannabis use. Interestingly, these findings were *only present in* patients with *current* cannabis use, which has led the authors to suggest that **abstinence may result in some cognitive improvement**. This study also explored the differences in cognitive functioning caused by *lifetime cannabis use* by comparing current and *former users* with patients who had *never used* cannabis, and found that *lifetime* cannabis users showed *better* psychomotor speed. patients who have never used cannabis represent an etiologically different subgroup of patients, presenting worse cognitive functioning even in the absence of drug use.
			- *drug interaction* may have cognitive effects not comparable with the ones related to exclusive consumption of cannabis or other types of drugs
			- difficult to find cannabis users who do not use tobacco. However, tobacco smoking has an important impact on cognition because it has been related to enhancement of attention, working memory, and information processing
			- These authors suggest that the finding of better cognitive functioning in cannabis users, compared with nonusers, may be a consequence of *including first-episode patients with cannabis-induced psychosis*, the heterogeneity of diagnoses, and the *absence of laboratory testing* to con- firm drug consumption.
			- In summary, most research points towards better cognitive function associated with cannabis use in psychotic patients. However, the results are inconclusive because of the methodological variability of the studies, the limited sample sizes, and the amount of research that has found no differences or poorer cognitive functioning in patients with comorbid cannabis use.

## Roman's Comments
- **Do we want to risk factors or correlates?** I want to change title and all description into correlates and discuss the potential DNA race predictor role in the discussion part. So that we will maintain all of the variables.
- *Time Scale*: who is in the sample, where did their trajectory start, how did the trajectory go from there, how did it differ depending on the risk factor. In Jonas et al (2022) JAMA Psychiatry, it was a good idea to place the *intercept at first admission*. However, the story of risk factors is much easier to tell and understand when the *origin is where your data begins* (i.e., childhood) and risk factors are already present there.
- *Predictors before the outcome*: If you want to tell a story of baseline risk factors, then the trajectory has to start at baseline, no pre-baseline outcome data (i.e., cognition) is allowed, unless you want to use pre-baseline cognition as a predictor. Importantly, you can either include pre-admission cognition and then talk about *SES, cannabis abuse etc as correlates* of trajectory OR exclude all pre-admission cognition and then talk about these variables as predictors. However, it is not possible to assess predictors half-way through the trajectory, there has to be temporal sequence to claim prediction.

lead time bias is functioning outcome

- *Cannabis name*: “lifetime” sounds like at any point by the 25-year follow-up, so “history” is clearer. Change to Baseline-lifetime cannabis use
- **Two Cannabis variables, use cannabis use disorders rather than cannabis use?**: These are two totally different variables. *Cannabis use* is from the NIDA Interview and it is *current vs. Cannabis Use Disorder* is from the SCID and it is lifetime at baseline. Moreover, CUD and current users are largely not the same people. *Cannabis use variable is described here*: Foti, D. J., Kotov, R., Guey, L. T., & Bromet, E. J. (2010). Cannabis use and the course of schizophrenia: 10-year follow-up after first hospitalization. American Journal of Psychiatry, 167(8), 987-993. *CUD diagnosis is described here*: Kotov, R., Chang, S. W., Fochtmann, L. J., Mojtabai, R., Carlson, G. A., Sedler, M. J., & Bromet, E. J. (2011). Schizophrenia in the internalizing-externalizing framework: a third dimension?. Schizophrenia bulletin, 37(6), 1168-1178.

- *Residential & Economic Independence variables*: Katherine, what about *social security* (i.e., it is support from the government but it was earned during work life of the participant), how did interviewers count it in this rating? Public assistance variable counts social security as assistance, but this variable is different.
- *Clarify the intercept and slope*: at study entry or first symptoms onset

- How to understand the comments: **cognitive profiles of these groups were virtually identical for bipolar and SZ**

- Analyses
	- [ ] It would be useful to **refit the models in the genotyped subsample to show that it still works** (or alternatively, another one is more optimal)—then report results in the Supplement. However, this is a considerable headache and we can wait to see whether reviewers bring this up or not.
	- [ ] *Table 1*: It does not make sense to stratify Table 1 according to SZ vs Other because all analyses were done in the full sample. Diagnosis is not really a part of this paper but Table 1 suggests that diagnosis plays a major role. This creates a contradiction. *Not stratify by the Diagnosis*
	- [ ] *Table 1*: Still 428? What about participants who died before year 25? What about attritors who were lost/refused at Year 25? I propose that we *structure this table as three sections* and move this age to the third section.
	- [ ] **Trajectory Figures: only significant one or all of variables in the study?**
	- [ ] Include intercept in the outcomes analyses: we did that just didn't report the coefficient of the intercept
	- [ ] childhood decline as predictor: Low IQ
	- [ ] functional decline: best baseline GAF. delta=baseline GAF- first available childhood
	- [x] Categorize DUP variable into two categories: 3-months
	- [x] report the null trajectory table
	- [ ] use index_age dataset to create delta-age
	- [x] time_BL_admit.  "stable" dataset. Time re-scale.
	- [x] Standardize the slope and intercept for the Outcome Analyses
	- [x] check supp 6. ![[Pasted image 20240118131746.png]]
	- [x] supp figure 1 race label is not correct.
- writing: 
	- Typo
		 - [x] *Non-white*
		 - [ ] Avoid mediation analysis tone: Non-white -> slope -> outcomes, *use greater slope correlates* with....
		 - [x]  It is odd to say that decline (even if a mild one) predicts good outcome. there were some cases who did not decline but rather improved. True: Change to "*increased cognitive trajectory predicts good outcomes compared to the decreased one*? PS: Also in fixed effect estimates is -0.28 but the extracted mean T2 slope is 0.
		- [x] *Correlates rather than predict*: Remission is an uncomfortable choice of a predictor. Remission only happens after first-episode, so remission is not a baseline predictor of future trajectory but sounds more like a contemporaneous correlate.
		- [x] *Clarify the change period*: Change is more accurate, because some participants improved (had positive slopes). Also, the trajectories model has two post-onset slopes (period 2 and period 3), it would be important to specify here which slopes went into prediction.
		- [x] *Table 2 description*: *Clarify it is the intercept and the 0 point of the time*. I believe you are referring here to the intercept of the trajectory at first hospitalization. Is this correct? If so, describe it accordingly. Yes, the intercept contributes to scores across the entire interval, but intercept score change s(in both absolute and relative terms) depending on where origin of the trajectory is placed.
		- [x] *Split Table 2 into 2 tables*: What sample do you want to report here? If the* baseline sample*, then *genetic effects* need to go to a separate Table. If the focus is on genetic effects than this should be the genotyped sample (i.e., 812 observations). Also important, does the *model include cognitive scores after Year 22?* If so, then need to show predictors of the second slope (i.e., after Year 22), otherwise the report looks incomplete and arbitrary. Also, *SES, Cannabis, and DUP* should go in a separate table of *correlates* of the trajectory.
		- [x] change β to B
		- [x] **Table 4: exp(β) over 1000. those are the odds ratio of being yes in the binary outcome. The slope is in the IQ metric.**. These statistics are not interpretable because predictor was not standardized. I recommend standardizing trajectory features or at least expressing them on IQ metric. Either way, I expect these ORs to be close to 2.0 not >1000.
		- [x] It would be much clearer to talk about these associations in the other direction (i.e., higher cognitive functioning at baseline). "lower genetic risk for bipolar disorder, lower socioeconomic status44, non white race/ethnicity, and non lifetime history of cannabis abuse were all associated with lower average cognitive ability"
		- [ ] Yes, size of effects is important. How large exactly? "We further identified that cognitive decline predicted the odds of remission, recovery, and financial independence 25 years after first admission. These effects were large"
	- Add detail
		- [ ]  report how much younger they were (i.e., difference between included vs excluded)
		- [ ] Define R2 in the table footnote
		- [ ] "The lifetime rate of cannabis use was 66.2%, and survival analysis revealed that this usage was associated with an earlier onset of psychosis. The rates of current use ranged from 10% to 18% across assessments." This is not correct. In the full sample of 628 distribution of this diagnosis is: 69.9% No diagnosis. 30.1% Lifetime diagnosis at baseline. I think you have this variable backwards. Does this mean that the observed effect of cannabis abuse actually is in the negative direction (history of disorder is liked to worse course)? **I checked the cannabis variable in 428. 119 non-user and 302 users**. The citation [Cannabis use and the course of schizophrenia: 10-year follow-up after first hospitalization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3594105/)
		- [ ] Consistent with prior research, cognitive decline predicted worse clinical psychosocial functional and employment outcomes. *Which studies and how exactly our findings interface with them*?
		- [ ] This may be attributed to a generally higher *cognitive reserve* in this group, meaning that when cognitive decline is observed, it often indicates a more advanced stage of the disease compared to individuals of non-white descent. It is unclear how this works exactly and needs more explication. However, I think the answer may be different, let’s suppose people with psychotic symptoms are more likely to need hospitalization because they are cognitively impaired or because they are non-white (due to various health disparities present in this group). **Then being non-white decrease probability of cognitive impairment because we are looking at the hospitalized sample**.
