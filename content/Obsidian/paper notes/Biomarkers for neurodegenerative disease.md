1. Aβ40: Aβ40 is a shorter variant of beta-amyloid, consisting of 40 amino acids. It is the most abundant form of beta-amyloid found in the brain. However, it is considered less prone to aggregation and less likely to form the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease.
2. Aβ42: Aβ42 is a slightly longer variant of beta-amyloid, comprising 42 amino acids. It is less abundant than Aβ40 but has a stronger tendency to aggregate and form the characteristic amyloid plaques seen in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Aβ42 is believed to be more directly associated with the neurotoxic effects of beta-amyloid.
3. Diagnostic and Research Significance: Measurements of Aβ40 and Aβ42, either individually or as a ratio (Aβ42/Aβ40), are used as potential biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, *decreased Aβ42* levels or alterations in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio have been associated with the presence of *Alzheimer*'s pathology.

*overproduction* of *precursor protein* associated with the *formation of an aberrant protein* tends to form and *accumulate* intra- and extracellular protein clumps that may be *related to neuronal death* in the affected part of the brain. 

**Specific biomarkers** that reflect a type of *accumulated pathological protein* include amyloid beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau), alpha-synuclein (α-syn), transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP- 43), and prion protein (PrPSc). Within **non-specific CSF biomarkers**, markers of *axonal damage and axonal degeneration*, including total tau protein (t-tau) and neurofilament light chains (*NFL*), have been the most studied. Among other non-specific markers, they are markers of synaptic, lysosomal, and mitochondrial dysfunction, proteins involved in the formation of intracellular proteins or participating in the degradation and clearance of abnormally modified proteins, and *markers of glial activation*.

**Neurofilaments** are the main structural components of long myelinated axons. Their high concentrations in CSF generally reflect rapidly progressive neurodegenerative processes. In contrast to FTD and atypical Parkinsonian syndromes, their CSF concentrations are normal in AD. As such, they can be used in differential diagnoses to distinguish AD from other diseases accompanied by dementia. As *blood NFLs* have a diagnostic *accuracy similar to CSF* NFLs, they may be a valid clinical tool in differential diagnosis between PD and APD [54]. NFLs could represent a powerful predictor of progression across parkinsonian phenotypes [55,56]. Their action is associated with hypometabolism and atrophy. Their levels rise in concentration together with hyperintensity of cerebral white matter. NFLs have also been found to *correlate* with patient *age* and *total tau* protein levels (t-tau) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein (*p-tau*), yet it does *not correlate* with *ApoEε4* genotype or patient sex.

**AD** is neuropathologically characterized by depositions of pathologically changed *amyloid β*-peptide in the form of amyloid *plaques* and hyperphosphorylated protein *tau* in the forms of neurofibrillary *tangles*. **Aβ40** is the prevailing isoform of Aβ, with which *no significant* changes in CSF levels *between AD and healthy controls* have been identified. *Increased* CSF concentrations of Aβ40 were observed *with AD as compared to Parkinson’s* disease dementia (PDD) and DLB, implying that the *Aβ42/Aβ40* ratio might better help to *distinguish* than Aβ42 alone between *AD and non-AD dementias*: mainly PDD, DLB, and vascular dementia. Moreover, as mentioned in studies by Toombs and Zetterberg [61] and by Lopez et al. [62], *plasma amyloid levels are influenced by several factors*. The majority of amyloid in the peripheral circulation is primarily bound to albumin, acute phase proteins, and complement components. As a result, low albumin levels or multifactorial environmental conditions (e.g., inflammation) can lead to decreasing plasma availability of the albumin necessary to transport Aβ to the blood [63]. On the other hand, Janelidze et al. [64], found that to a certain extent, Aβ levels in the blood only reflect dysregulated Aβ metabolism degraded by circulating enzymes, or its metabolism in the liver which can potentially reduce monitoring of Aβ metabolism and its aggregation in the brain. Other factors unrelated to amyloid pathology may be modulated by peptide levels in the brain.

Recent studies have reported that based on a blood test measuring one of the two forms of **phosphorylated tau** protein (p-tau181 or p-tau217), it is possible to differentially *diagnose AD* from another neurodegenerative disease with high accuracy [65,66]. However, the plasma p-tau181 level does not appear to increase any further in cases with moderate or severe tau pathology. In contrast, plasma p-tau217 is a confirmed dynamic biomarker of early stage AD, which may be useful for monitoring the disease progression in clinical practice and in treatment of AD [69]. 

However, the sensitivity of the **ELISA** method is not sufficient for identifying and reliably quantifying the concentration of CNS biomarkers in plasma or serum. Fortunately, advanced and highly sensitive techniques have markedly improved the detection of peripheral biomarkers in technologies related to the enhanced availability of ultrasensitive and more sensitive analytical methods, such as the single molecule array (**SIMOA**) method and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) microarrays, allowing the bridging and eliminating of many obstacles so that blood biomarkers have a promising future. They represent a valid tool for defining target engagement as well as for long-term monitoring of treatment results


#### Blood Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Diseases Implications for the Clinical Neurologist
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/cog%20trajectory%20in%20SZ/Blood%20Biomarkers%20in%20Neurodegenerative%20Diseases%20Implications%20for%20the%20Clinical%20Neurologist.pdf)

some proteins, such as NfL, appear to be **neuronal-specific**, many others, including Aβ, are highly **expressed in other tissues**, and thus their concentrations in blood might not necessarily reflect neurological changes. In addition, measurements of proteins in blood may be complicated due to their rapid degradation by blood proteases, hepatic clearance, interference by peripheral antibodies and/or binding to peripheral proteins, such as albumin.

The most rigorously studied blood biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases are Aβ peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42), NfL, total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Of these biomarkers, **p-tau** is emerging as the most consistent in terms of sensitivity and specificity to detect AD in older adults. correlation between the concentrations of the different p-tau assays is high among older adults, but relatively low in younger adults, possibly due to low concentrations of the biomarkers. Large-cohort studies have shown that **p-tau** in blood has excellent accuracy to detect AD pathology along the disease and has high correlation with both amyloid and tau PET.5,6,13 Plasma p-tau concentrations have shown high accuracy for the *differentiation between AD and other* forms of neurodegenerative diseases *at early disease stages*. In the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, for example, longitudinal increases in plasma p-tau181 were associated with worse decline in memory, executive function, language, visuospatial function, amyloid burden by PET, regional brain hypometabolism and with CSF Aβ42, p-tau181 and total tau concentrations.e14

Neurofilament light (**NfL**) is a neuron-specific axonal protein and plasma concentrations increase in a wide variety of neurological conditions affecting either the central or the peripheral nervous system (neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, hypoxia and polyneuropathy, among others).e4 NfL concentrations in plasma and serum can be measured using Simoa-based assays, and they show high correlation with those in CSF.17,e4 Although it is not specific for a particular etiology, it has been proposed as a potential candidate for the screening of neurological damage and a *useful tool to monitor disease progression in several neurodegenerative diseases.* 22,e4 High blood NfL concentrations also have value in distinguishing individuals with atypical parkinsonism due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), from those caused by alpha-synucleinopathies.e9 Other studies have provided evidence that high plasma NfL may be used to *distinguish patients* with early onset dementia from patients with behavioral symptoms due to primary *psychiatric disorders*.e10 high NfL identifies asymptomatic, prodromal and fully symptomatic genetic FTLD individuals at high risk of clinical progression.34  Similarly, plasma NfL concentrations show trends for longitudinal intraindividual increases over time that correlated with decline in cognitive impairment.35 Similar associations between high plasma NfL concentrations and disease progression are evident in FTLD.36

Glial fibrillary acidic protein (**GFAP**) is mainly expressed in brain astrocytes. An increase in its concentration in blood has been found in patients after mild traumatic *brain injury* (TBI).23,24 Recent studies have also shown that GFAP concentrations in plasma are higher in *AD* patients than in controls and are also associated with amyloid pathology.25–27 High concentrations of plasma GFAP have also been reported in patients with *frontotemporal lobar degeneration-related syndromes* but to a lesser extent than those in AD.28,29

abnormal plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 is associated with a 15-fold increase in the risk of conversion from negative to positive amyloid PET in cognitively asymptomatic individuals.11

In chronological order, the disease appears to start with an overproduction of an amyloid beta isoform that is 42-aminoacids long (Abeta42, A) followed by an accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles rich in truncated and phosphorylated tau (T) which results in neurodegeneration (N) (Masters et al., 2015).

		- Disease types
			1. Alzheimer disease (AD)
			2. Primary tauopathies
				- AD is not usually classified as a "primary" tauopathy because another type of protein, beta-amyloid, also accumulates and contributes to the disease process.
				- Disease include
					1. **Pick's disease** 
						- also known as frontotemporal dementia with Pick bodies: This condition is characterized by *personality changes*, difficulties with language and behavior, and sometimes motor symptoms. At a cellular level, it is defined by the presence of *Pick bodies*, which are tau-positive inclusions in neurons.
						- ![[Pasted image 20230730105450.png]] 
					2. **Progressive supranuclear palsy** (PSP)
						- This disease involves difficulties with balance and walking, abnormal eye movements, and cognitive changes. It is associated with the accumulation of tau protein in specific areas of the brain.
					3. **Corticobasal degeneration** (CBD)
						- This condition is characterized by motor abnormalities such as rigidity and dystonia, cognitive impairment, and specific types of apraxia. Like PSP, it is associated with abnormal *tau accumulation* in *specific brain regions*.
					4. **Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy** (CTE)
						- This condition is associated with a history of repeated head traumas and presents with behavioral changes, mood disturbances, and cognitive impairment. It's characterized by abnormal tau accumulation, especially around blood vessels.
			3. **Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)**
				- Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a group of disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. These areas are generally associated with personality, behavior, and language, and as these regions degenerate, patients typically show progressive difficulties in these areas.
			4. **Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)**
				- 肌萎缩侧索硬化症 affects *motor neurons*, which are nerve cells that control voluntary muscle movements like speaking, walking, and swallowing. As ALS progresses, the motor neurons deteriorate and die, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy.  The cause of ALS is not well understood. In about 5 to 10 percent of cases, ALS is inherited in a familial form, with known mutations in several genes, including the C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP, and FUS genes. The *majority* of cases, however, are *sporadic* with no known family history.
				- It's important to note that some people with ALS may develop cognitive and behavioral changes, and there is overlap between ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), with some individuals experiencing symptoms of both conditions. This is often referred to as *ALS-FTD*.
			5. Synucleinopathies
				- Synucleinopathies 突触核蛋白 are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the abnormal accumulation of *aggregates* of *alpha-synuclein* protein in *neurons*, nerve *fibers*, or *glial cells*. Alpha-synuclein is a protein that, in its normal state, likely plays a role in maintaining a *supply of synaptic vesicles 小泡* in presynaptic terminals. However, it can misfold and form aggregates, leading to neuronal degeneration. 
				- Disease include
					1. **Multisystem atrophy** (MSA)
						- This is a rare, rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects autonomic functions and movement. It is characterized by *glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs)*, which are *abnormal alpha-synuclein aggregates* in glial cells (predominantly form in *oligodendrocytes* 少突胶质细胞, a type of glial cell)
						- The cause of MSA is still unknown, though it is *not* considered a *hereditary* disorder. Neuropathologically, MSA is characterized by the build-up of a protein called alpha-synuclein in certain cells in the brain (oligodendroglia), leading to the formation of structures known as glial cytoplasmic inclusions.
					2.  **Parkinson's Disease** (PD)
						- It is the most common synucleinopathy. It is characterized by the degeneration of *dopamine-producing neurons* in the substantia nigra, a part of the brain that plays a key role in movement. PD patients exhibit Lewy bodies, which are abnormal aggregates of alpha-synuclein.
						- 帕金森病 (PD) 和路易体痴呆 (DLB) 都是神经退行性疾病，其特征是大脑中存在路易体（异常蛋白质聚集体）。 然而，它们具有不同的临床特征和诊断标准：帕金森病 (PD)：这种疾病主要表现为运动症状，通常先于认知障碍出现。 典型的运动症状包括静止性震颤、运动迟缓（运动缓慢）、僵硬和姿势不稳定。 也可能出现非运动症状，包括睡眠障碍、嗅觉丧失、便秘以及抑郁和焦虑等情绪障碍。 随着疾病的进展，认知问题可能会出现，在某些情况下，这些问题可能会发展为帕金森病痴呆（PDD）。 然而，PD 中的痴呆通常发生在疾病的后期。路易体痴呆 (DLB)：在 DLB 中，认知症状是一个显着特征，并且发生在病程早期。 DLB 痴呆通常表现为认知波动（注意力和警觉性的变化）、幻视和帕金森症。 DLB 中的帕金森症可能不像 PD 中那样明显，并且可能在认知症状出现的同时或之后发生。 其他症状可能包括快速眼动睡眠行为障碍、对抗精神病药物严重敏感以及自主神经功能障碍。症状出现的时间是区分 DLB 和 PD 的关键因素。 在 DLB 中，痴呆症状在帕金森病之前或同时发生。 相比之下，在帕金森病中，运动症状先于认知能力下降，当帕金森运动症状出现一年多后痴呆发生时，即可诊断为帕金森病。
					3. Lewy body dementia (**LBD**)
						- *Lewy bodies*, which are spherical inclusions *within neurons* composed of *alpha-synuclein* and other proteins, are a hallmark of several disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD).
						- Abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein *accumulate* in areas of the *brain* that regulate *behavior, cognition, and movement*. The disease is named after the scientist Friedrich Lewy who first discovered these protein deposits.
			6. Huntington disease (HD) and related polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases (including spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA))
				- **Polyglutamine** (polyQ) diseases are a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by an abnormal expansion of a sequence of the DNA (CAG triplet repeat) that codes for the amino acid glutamine. This leads to the production of proteins with abnormally long stretches of glutamine, known as polyglutamine tracts, which can cause the protein to fold abnormally and form aggregates in cells, leading to disease. *Length of the polyglutamine* tract is generally correlated with the *severity of disease* and the age of onset; longer tracts tend to cause more severe disease that begins earlier in life. 
					- **Glutamine** 谷氨酰胺 is one of the 20 amino acids that are the building blocks of proteins in living organisms. These amino acids are vital for a wide range of biological functions, including protein synthesis, regulation of gene expression, and maintaining cellular health.**谷氨酰胺** 是 20 种氨基酸之一，是生物体中蛋白质的组成部分。 这些氨基酸对于多种生物功能至关重要，包括蛋白质合成、基因表达调节和维持细胞健康。 人体可以合成谷氨酰胺，因此它被认为是一种条件必需氨基酸。 这意味着在正常情况下通常不需要从饮食中获取它。 然而，在患有严重疾病、压力或受伤时，身体对谷氨酰胺的需求可能超过其产生的能力，因此饮食摄入变得更加重要。值得注意的是，大脑中过度的谷氨酰胺活性可能导致阿尔茨海默病、肌萎缩侧索硬化症等疾病。 因此，虽然它是许多生物过程的关键氨基酸，但与所有事物一样，它需要保持平衡。与其他氨基酸相比，Glutamine has a unique structure compared to other amino acids as it contains *two nitrogen groups* 谷氨酰胺具有独特的结构，因为它含有两个氮基团, 它在体内发挥着几个关键作用：
						- 蛋白质合成：像所有氨基酸一样，谷氨酰胺用于在体内构建蛋白质。
						- 能量来源：体内的某些细胞，例如肠道和免疫系统中的细胞，使用谷氨酰胺作为能量来源。
						- *Nitrogen transport* 氮运输：谷氨酰胺有助于氮在器官和组织之间的运输。
						- Neurotransmitter production 神经递质的产生：Glutamine can be *converted* into **glutamate**, an important neurotransmitter in the brain. 谷氨酰胺可以转化为 **谷氨酸**，谷氨酸是大脑中重要的神经递质。
						- 免疫系统支持：谷氨酰胺对于免疫细胞（包括某些白细胞和肠道细胞）的最佳功能至关重要。
						- 调节酸碱平衡：谷氨酰胺通过产生氨来帮助调节体内的pH值，从而帮助维持体内的酸碱平衡。
					- The information in a *gene* is written in a genetic code, which is read in *groups of three nucleotide bases*. Each group of three bases, called a *codon*, corresponds to one of the 20 different *amino acids* used to build proteins. 
						- 基因中的信息以遗传密码写入，以三个核苷酸碱基为一组来读取。 每组三个碱基称为密码子，对应于用于构建蛋白质的 20 种不同氨基酸中的一种。 例如，密码子AUG编码氨基酸甲硫氨酸，密码子GCU、GCC、GCA和GCG均编码氨基酸丙氨酸。
						- 氨基酸由与四个不同基团键合的中心碳原子组成：氨基（-NH2）羧基（-COOH）氢原子（H）不同氨基酸之间变化的侧链（表示为“R”）。 正是这条侧链赋予了每种氨基酸独特的特性。
				- Disease include
					1. **Huntington's disease (HD)** 
						- This is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder. It results from a mutation in the *Huntingtin gene (HTT)* that leads to an abnormal repetition of a DNA sequence (CAG triplet repeat). This mutation results in the production of an *abnormally long version of the Huntingtin protein*, which tends to aggregate within neurons and cause cell damage and death over time. Symptoms include uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of cognition.
						- Huntington's disease is caused by an inherited *mutation* in the Huntingtin (*HTT*) gene, which produce a *mutant* version of the *huntingtin protein* that *contains* an excessively *long chain of glutamines*, known as a polyglutamine tract. Under normal conditions, the huntingtin protein has a chain of 10 to 35 glutamines. However, in individuals with Huntington's disease, the chain can be much longer – containing 36 to over 100 glutamines. This causes the huntingtin protein to fold abnormally and form aggregates in neurons. Over time, these aggregates lead to disruption of normal cellular functions, neuronal death, and the manifestation of Huntington's disease symptoms.
					2. **Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA or Kennedy's disease)** 
						- 脊髓延髓肌萎缩症 Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy's disease, is a rare, *X-linked recessive* X 连锁隐性 neurodegenerative disorder. It primarily affects *males*, with symptoms typically starting in adulthood. The disease is characterized by the gradual weakening and wasting (atrophy) of the muscles, especially those in the arms and legs, and bulbar muscles, which control breathing, swallowing, and speaking.
						- SBMA is caused by a *mutation* in the *androgen receptor (AR) gene*. The gene's normal function is to provide instructions for making a protein that plays a key role in the activities of male sex hormones (androgens). The mutation in this gene leads to an *abnormally long* stretch of a protein building block (amino acid) called *glutamine*, a condition referred to as a polyglutamine or polyQ disease. Similar to Huntington's disease, which is also a polyQ disorder, this mutation causes the protein to *fold abnormally* and form *aggregates*, which are harmful to nerve cells.
					3. **Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)** 
						- 齿状红核-苍白球路易体萎缩症 the *gene* involved is called *ATN1*, and the trinucleotide sequence that is repeated is CAG, which codes for the amino acid glutamine. Normally, the ATN1 gene has 6 to 35 CAG repeats, but in people with DRPLA, the gene may have anywhere from 48 to 93 repeats, leading to an excessively long glutamine chain (a polyglutamine tract) in the atrophin-1 protein.
					4. **Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs)** 
						- 脊髓小脑性共济失调 Represent a diverse *group* of *rare*, *genetic neurodegenerative* disorders characterized by *progressive problems with movement*. The name "spinocerebellar ataxia" is actually a term encompassing a number of different conditions, all of which involve *degeneration of the cerebellum*, the part of the brain responsible for controlling coordination, balance, and fine motor control.
						- There are *many types* of SCAs, *each* associated with a *specific genetic mutation*. They are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Some of the more common types include SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 (also known as Machado-Joseph disease), and SCA6, among others.
			7. Prion disease (PrD)
				- Also known as *transmissible* spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) 传染性海绵状脑病, are a group of *rare*, fatal brain diseases that affect both *humans and animals*. They are caused by *prions* 朊病毒, which are abnormal, pathogenic agents that are transmissible and are able to *induce abnormal folding* of specific normal cellular proteins called *prion proteins* that are found most abundantly in the brain.
				- Disease include
					1. **Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)**
						- This is the most common human prion disease. It is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia, neurological symptoms and visual impairment.
					2. **Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)**
						- This is an infectious form of the disease that is related to "*mad cow disease*." Eating contaminated meat may cause the disease in humans. The symptoms of vCJD are slightly different from classic CJD and the disease tends to occur in younger individuals.
					3. **Fatal familial insomnia (FFI)**
						- This inherited prion disease is characterized by insomnia that worsens over time, along with a number of other symptoms.
					4. **Kuru**
						- This disease was observed in the Fore people of Papua New Guinea and was transmitted through endocannibalism 同类相食. The disease is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, or loss of coordination and balance.
			8. **Traumatic brain injury (TBI)**
			9. **Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)**
			10. Stroke
			11. **Spinal cord injury (SCI)**
			12. **Multiple sclerosis (MS)**
				- Is a chronic, typically progressive disease involving damage to the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).
				- It's widely accepted that MS is an *autoimmune* condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath, a protective covering of the nerve cells in the central nervous system.

	- Generation of aggregating dipeptide repeats (DPRs) from hexanucleotide repeat sequences, generated by *repeat- associated non-ATG (RAN) translation*
		- Polyglutamine disease
		- Myotonic dystrophy, which is caused by expansions of CTG repeats in one gene or CCTG repeats in another
		- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD), which can be caused by an expansion of a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat
		- the expanded repeat sequences can be transcribed into RNA and then, through RAN translation, can be translated in all three reading frames into proteins with *repeating amino acids*, known as *dipeptide repeat proteins*. These repeat proteins can form aggregates inside cells and are thought to contribute to disease symptoms
- **Close correlation** between the *aggregation* process and *symptom* progression. However, *not always correlated*. Some cases weak correlation, some cases no aggregated protein are observed
- **Biomarkers**
	- *Amyloid*: amyloid PET, CSF and plasma Aβ42-40 ratio
	- *Tau*: also reflect amyloid build-up. CSF and plasma p-tau. tau-PET is less suited for primary taupathies than for AD taupathy due to conformational differences
	- *TDP-43, a-synuclein or prion*: these proteins are spread in prion-like manner (not transfer between individuals but correlate with toxicity, aggregation, and propagation)
		- seeding aggregation assays, such as real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) or protein-misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), could be used to qualitatively detect pathological forms of the proteins in CSF. 
##### 2. Synaptic and neuronal network dysfunction
- Synaptic failure and toxicity seem to be an early event **preceding neuronal loss** in many NDDs
- Neuronal network function requires precise synaptic function and synaptic function is **modulated by** *neurotransmitter* and *calcium* changes, *cytoskeletal* adaptations, presynaptic *vesicle* dynamics, and post-synaptic *signaling*
- **Excitotoxicity**
	- by *excess glutamate* causes neuronal death by excessive Ca2+ influx. Increased Ca2+ causes mitochondrial dysfunction and concomitant energy depletion, as well as activation of enzymes, such as calpains, resulting in degradation of proteins and lipids, dysregulation of physiological functions, and ultimately cell death.
	- important mechanisms in the etiology of *ALS*
- **Protein aggregation**
	- a-synuclein in PD, Htt in HD, APP/Ab and tau in AD, and tauopathies
- **Genes** that are linked to proper synaptic function are known to be mutated in certain NDDs
	- SNCA, SYNJ1, DNAJC6, and DNAJC13 in PD, and C9orf72 in ALS/FTD)
- **Detection**
	- Functional magnetic resonance imaging (*fMRI*), which assesses *neuronal network connectivity*, indicates early network dysfunction
	- Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (*FDG-PET*) reveals decreased glucose *metabolism* in AD, in line with decreased *neuronal function* in the disease
	- a *PET* method that images *synaptic density* using a ligand targeting the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) was recently developed
	- targeted *assays* to measure panels of pre-, trans-, and post-synaptic proteins in CSF
##### 3. Aberrant proteostasis
- The ubiquitin-proteasome system (**UPS**) and autophagy-lysosome pathway (**ALP**) constitute two major cellular mechanisms for maintaining protein homeostasis.
	- The UPS mainly degrades marked proteins, whereas ALP clears protein aggregates and defective organelles
	- The UPS and ALP involve *ubiquitylation* to target proteins and cargo for degradation and are *linked by p62* (SQSTM1), which binds ubiquitin and targets cargo to the ALP, with fusion to autophagic vesicles and subsequent lysosomal degradation being the final step
	- They are induced by starvation or stress conditions involving low energy or low availability of constituents (namely specific amino acids)
- **UPS**
	- *genes* linked to *familial* forms of *NDDs* maintain key functions in the *UPS* response (UBQLN2 and VCP)
		- *Parkin* (a PD-linked gene) encodes a ubiquitin-protein ligase, and *UCHL1*, linked to a rare progressive NDD form, encodes a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase, further pointing to a role of the UPS in NDDs.
	- Moreover, *aggregation* of proteins associated with sporadic NDDs, such as tau, TDP-43, a-synuclein and polyQ-containing proteins, *impairs UPS function*, suggesting a wider association with more common forms of NDD. protein aggregation has been linked to *decreased ATP* levels
- **ALP**
	- *inactivation* of *autophagy* by *knockout* of Atg7 in *mice* causes *neurodegeneration* and premature death with concomitant accumulation of aggregated proteins.
	- *Chaperone 分子伴侣 mediated autophagy* also prevents *collapse* of the neuronal metastable proteome that includes *AD-related proteins*.
	- *genes* linked to *NDDs* exert physiological roles in the regulation of *autophagy*
		- SQSTM1 gene encoding the p62 protein, which links UPS and ALP by binding ubiquitin and targeting cargo to the ALP, give rise to ALS/FTD cases.
		- PD exert crucial roles in autophagy, lysosomal function, and endolysosomal trafficking, including several key proteins (i.e., LRRK2, SYNJ1, DNAJC6, and DNAJC13 (RME-8)) important for controlling endocytosis and autophagy at the synapse
		- PINK1, Parkin, LRRK2, a-synuclein, Htt, and ataxin 3 are involved in autophagy, endolysosomal trafficking, and protein degradation
	- acts at the level of the synapse, contributing to *synaptic protein homeostasis*
	- *aggregating proteins* have been detected at pre-and post- *synaptic* sites where they can *cause* dysregulation of the *ALP* and synaptic function
- **Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs)**
	- *recessive* loss-of-function *mutations* of LSDs, *neurodegeneration* is part of the clinical disease presentation. Niemann- Pick’s disease type C1 (NPC) and Gaucher disease
	- *Genes* related to NDDs also linked to LSDs {GBA (b-glucocerebrosidase) and GRN (progranulin)}, and play key role in LSDs {ATP13A2 (lysosomal polyamine exporter) in PD}
	- *Interaction* with other hallmarks
		- ALP transfer of *aggregation*-prone proteins, similar to the prion-like propagation. 
			- endolysosomal trafficking following *uptake* of *tau-seeds* and subsequent lysosomal *rupture promotes* cytosolic access to aggregated tau
		- Neuronal cell *death*
		- *Energy*: ALP is essential for *mitophagy* and hence proper *mitochondrial* function 
		- Synaptic and axonal function
##### 4. Cytoskeletal abnormalities
1. **Microtubules**
	-  These are hollow tubes composed of protein subunits called *tubulin*. In neurons, microtubules are the *largest* of the cytoskeletal filaments and are critical for maintaining the structure of the axon and dendrites, the long processes that extend from the cell body. Microtubules also provide tracks for the transport of materials between the cell body and the ends of the axon and dendrites, a process called *axonal transport*. 
		-  Axonal transport regulates the transport of proteins, lipids, mRNA, and organelles including mitochondria to synapses
	- *Tau*: Tau proteins can bind to microtubules and stabilize their structure, facilitating the transport of various materials along the axon. *MAPT gene* (encoded tau) mutation is discovered in taupathies
2. **Neurofilaments**: These are intermediate filaments found specifically in neurons. Like microtubules, neurofilaments help maintain the structure of the neuron, particularly the diameter of the axon, which is crucial for the proper conduction of electrical signals.
	- Neurofilament *aggregates* form a liquid crystal gel network in ALS, AD, PD, FTD, SMA, SCA1, and other NDDs.
	- Concentrations in biofluids has been used as *biomarkers* for several NDDs, including ALS, MS, TBI, stroke, and dementias
3. **Actin Filaments (Microfilaments)**: These are *thinest* filaments composed of the protein actin. They are especially important in maintaining the structure of the *dendritic spines*, which are small protrusions from the dendrites where synapses are formed. 
	- aggregation of actin, with a key role in synaptic dynamics, occurs in several NDDs, and likely contributes to neurodegenerative processes.
- **Genes**
	- components of the axonal transport machinery: Charcot Marie tooth [CMT]/ALS/spastic paraplegia [SPG], also related to NDDs
- Disease
	- Spinal cord injury (SCI) as one of the NDDs
	- Axonal dysfunction and degeneration are recognized as prominent contributors to disease progression in ALS, MS, TBI, and PD, as well as in PNS and ocular disorders.
- **Interaction**
	- loss of synaptic maintenance and altered *energy* metabolism, *RNA* transport, protein *aggregation* and autophagy, and neuronal *death*
	- Release of cytoskeletal proteins (including neurofilament and tau) can induce *inflammatory* reactions, which can further aggravate existing cytoskeletal defects.
##### 5. Altered energy homeostasis
- *ATP* is the key molecule of brain energy metabolism, which can be fueled by glucose or lactate metabolism, and is generated by oxidative phosphorylation in *mitochondria* via the electron transport chain.
- **Roels**
	- *ion balance* (ATP-consuming membrane pumps), calcium homeostasis
	- *cytoskeletal dynamics*
	- *proteostasis*
	- *oxidative stress*: increased release of free electrons that react with oxygen or nitrogen, giving rise to macromolecular damage via **reactive oxygen species (ROS)** attack of proteins, lipids and/or nucleic acids.
- **Disease**
	- stroke: excitotoxicity and energy depletion cooperatively drive neurodegenerative processes.
	- SCI: concomitant effects of axonal injury, excitotoxicity, and energy depletion promote neurodegeneration
- **Assessment**: FDG-PET, measure regional glucose metabolism in the brain
- *Altered energy homeostasis* is reflected in altered FDG-PET in *most*, if not all, *NDDs*
- **Evidence**
	- *inherited* defects in enzymes of glycolysis, lipid metabolism, or *mitochondrial* metabolism *exhibit* symptoms of *nervous* system *malfunction*.
	- Several rare disorders that display neurological defects also arise from *mutations* in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
	- Classic *mitochondrial syndromes* present with diverse symptoms, including neurological features
	- several *genes* linked to NDDs, particularly PD (Parkin, PINK1) and CMT (mitofusin2), have been reported to regulate mitochondrial quality control pathways
	- *Aggregation*-prone proteins including a-synuclein and tau *modulate actin-dependent mitochondrial fission 分裂*.
##### 6. DNA and RNA defects
- **Damage source**
	- The genome and transcriptome of cells are *susceptible* to spontaneous decay and *damage* by a wide range of *intracellular or environmental agents*.
	- In the CNS, the *major genotoxins* are presumed to be the *ROS* generated as byproducts of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
- **Consequences**
	- *mutagenesis*, chromosome *rearrangements*, RNA transcription *arrest*, or DNA *replication fork collapse*, events that can promote *cell dysfunction* and cell *death*
- **DNA**
	- DNA **repair disorder**
		- *rare inherited disorders* that exhibit neurological complications result from *defects* in the ability to efficiently *respond* to and *clear genomic stress*.
			1. mutations in genes that encode proteins that normally operate to resolve DNA double-strand breaks (**DSBs**) or **replicative stress** (e.g., ataxia telangiectasia [AT] 毛细血管扩张性共济失调) can lead to *brain atrophy* later in life, consistent with endogenous DNA damage promoting progressive neuronal cell loss
			2. Several NDDs, mostly recessive ataxias, also originate from inherited defects in the ability to resolve DNA single-strand breaks (**SSBs**), frequent products of *ROS attack* of DNA.
				- These *SSB* repair disorders exhibit *strictly neurological* phenotypes *without cancer* predisposition 
					- elevated endogenous strand breaks result in transcriptional arrest and *activation* of cell *death* pathways in non-dividing *neurons*, whereas SSB damage is *cleared* faithfully by replication-directed homologous recombination repair *in dividing cells*.
			3. **transcription-blocking lesions** driving neurological disease, inherited defects in components of the transcription-coupled sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) give rise to neurodegeneration
				- Recessive mutations in senataxin (SETX), an RNA-DNA helicase, are linked to ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2)
				- Rare dominant mutations are seen in a juvenile-onset form of ALS, implicating genomic R-loops (i.e., RNA-DNA hybrids, frequent intermediates of transcription) in neuronal cell death
	- DNA **damage processing defects**
		- *increased* oxidative *DNA damage*, often arising in concert with mitochondrial dysfunction, has been shown in *disease tissue*
			- compromised repair of oxidative DNA damage may be a *risk modifier* for neurological degeneration in AD models and PD- like pathology
		- DNA *DSBs accumulate* in vulnerable neuronal and glial cell populations from early stages *onward in AD*, possibly due to *reduced* expression of key *DSB response proteins*
		- *NDDs proteins* participate in various DNA damage responses, most commonly in the context of *DNA strand breaks*
			- tauopathies (tau), ALS/FTD (TDP-43 and FUS), HD (Htt), spinocerebellar ataxia (ATXN2), or SMA (SMN1/SNM2)
			- aggregates of a-synuclein can activate the DSB response kinase mutated in AT (i.e., ATM)
			- elevated levels of poly(ADP)ribose, a product of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) hyperactivity, accelerates the fibrillization of a-synuclein
- **RNA**
	- *RNA* metabolism and *homeostasis*, which *encompass* processes such as *transcription*, RNA *splicing*, transport and *degradation*, *translation*, and the biogenesis of *regulatory non-coding RNAs*, is a complex collective that involves numerous *interactions with RNA-binding proteins*
	- Abnormalities in any of the components of RNA regulation has **consequences** on *protein translation*, protein *aggregation*, and *RNA interference* (RNAi) and *RNA species*
		- lead to defects in RNA driven processes and RNA transport, as well as to the formation of **characteristic stress granules (SGs)**.
			- SGs are dense cytosolic ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) complexes that are formed in response to cellular stress to *temporally inhibit translation* and *store mRNAs*.
		- **RAN translation** (repeat-associated RNA-encoded, non-ATG translation) can lead to the generation of different repeat proteins
			- polyQ diseases
	- **Evidence**
		- Mislocalized *TDP-43*, which functions as an RNA-binding protein, causes altered RNA splicing, RNA stability, and RNA transport
		- pathogenic mutations in *FUS* cause mislocalization of the normally nuclear protein to the cytoplasm, leading to defects in RNA metabolism, specifically of transcripts encoding proteins regulating dendritic growth and synaptic functions
		- RNA metabolism defects are also linked to *C9orf72* linked FTD/ALS
		- multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), caused by mutations in the heterogeneous **nuclear RNP** A1 (*HNRNPA1*) or A2B1 (*HNRNPA2B1*) gene
		- *Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)*, as SMN1/ SMN2 are transacting factors involved in splicing
			- SMA is caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene that codes for survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons
		- *SG cytoplasmic aggregates* is also thought to play an important role in the NDD process
			- Several RNA-binding proteins associated with FTD and ALS (i.e., TDP-43, FUS, EWSR1, TAF15, hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2B1, ATXN2, TIA1, and VCP) are involved in SG dynamics.
- **Connection**
	- Recent evidence also indicates that the accumulation of nuclear DNA damage leads to hyperactivation of the DNA damage sensor PARP1, consequent *NAD consumption*, and mitochondrial dysfunction
		- NAD can be consumed in several ways:
			1. **Metabolism**: NAD plays a key role in cellular respiration, helping cells convert food into usable energy. It acts as an electron carrier in the process of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, where it is converted between its oxidized form (NAD+) and its reduced form (NADH). This process consumes NAD and produces ATP, the energy currency of the cell.
			2. **DNA repair and stress response**: NAD is used by enzymes called poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), which help repair damaged DNA. PARPs use NAD to add ADP-ribose units to proteins—a process called ADP-ribosylation. This process consumes NAD.
			3. **Cell signaling**: NAD is used by enzymes called sirtuins, which remove acetyl groups from proteins, a key process in regulating protein function and gene expression. This deacetylation reaction consumes NAD.
			4. **Cell death**: During certain types of cell death, an enzyme called ADP-ribose transferase (ART) can rapidly deplete cellular NAD.
	- *SG* formation can be *induced by* dysfunctional *UPS*, culminating in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins.
##### 7. Inflammation
- Neuroinflammation, including *microgliosis* and *astrogliosis*, is a pathological hallmark of NDDs, including AD, PD, ALS, HD, and stroke
	- *invariable presence* of inflammation in postmortem brain samples of NDD patients
	- prototypic neuroinflammatory disease MS
- **Microgliosis**
	- invariably detected in *all NDDs*
	- Microglia normally exert *sensor*, *housekeeping*, and *defense* functions in the brain, and aberrations in these functions can lead to neurodegeneration
		- react to *pathogens* or signs of *injury*. Upon activation, microglia are involved in *cytokine*/chemokine production, *phagocytosis* activation, *dysregulation* of physiological functions, and *ROS* production.
		- After an acute stressor, the inflammatory process is normally actively resolved
		- failure to resolve results in **chronic inflammation** that can promote the neurodegenerative process
			- *due to* the presence of danger signals, such as protein *aggregates*, *misfolded* proteins, damaged *synapses*, Ca2+ influx, or mitochondrial *ROS*
				- Several *aggregated* NDD proteins induce microglial activation, such as *Ab, tau, a-synuclein, PrP fibrils, or SOD1*
	- Moreover, a *transition* between different microglial *states* is believed to occur during the disease process, with particular populations specifically associated with neurodegeneration (e.g., disease-associated microglia [DAM] or microglial neurodegenerative phenotype [MgND])
	- Insights into the *detrimental* and *protective* roles of the different microglial populations will be important for effective *therapeutic* targeting in NDDs.
	- Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (**TREM2**)
		- loss-of-function *mutations* in individuals with Nasu-Hakola disease, a rare disorder associated with *neurodegeneration* leading to dementia and premature death
		- *only expressed in microglia* in the brain
		- TREM2 function appears to be *protective* against Ab-related local toxicity, whereas *later* in the tauopathy phase of disease, its function may be *detrimental*
	- ApoE, acting through microglia, plays an important role in driving tau-mediated neurodegeneration
		- A close relationship between *lipid metabolism* and *microglial activation* is emerging as lipid related genes are upregulated in the transition from homeostatic to damage-associated microglia
- **Astrocytes** 
	- are crucial for proper neuronal functioning and exert a key role in preserving *glutamate homeostasis* and are a vital part of the *tri-synaptic network*
	- *microglia* closely *interact* with and activate astrocytes
	- Astrocytes release extracellular factors, including chemokines and cytokines, and play a key role in *glial scar formation*.
	- Astrocytes may also be a direct *target* of protein *aggregation* pathology in some NDDs
- **Biomarker**
	- glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), TREM2, and certain cytokines
##### 8. Neuronal cell death
- Several inherent **properties** of neurons may make them especially *vulnerable* to cell *death* in NDD. 
	1. their *post-mitotic nature* resulting in 
		1. the gradual *accumulation* of age-associated *damage* to DNA, lipids, proteins, and organelles and 
		2. the *inability* to replicate and *replenish* the neural cell population 
	2. their *high energy requirements*, mainly due to the need to support synaptic function, and the associated ROS production via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
	3. their extended axons and dendrites, leading to a *requirement* for *transport* and *structural organization* over long distances 
	4. their *dependence* on *glial cells* for *maintenance*, *energy*, and *defense*. As a result, neurons appear to be more susceptible to cell death, a characteristic that is exacerbated by an age-associated decline in resilience mechanisms.
##### Framework
![[Pasted image 20230731105609.png|800]]
1. The interconnectedness of NDD hallmarks highlights the need for *multi-targeted therapies*
	-  When targeting only one NDD hallmark, the dis- ease process may be overtaken by one of the other hallmarks, suggesting a necessity for combinatorial multi-target therapies to effectively halt NDDs.
2. identifying commonalities and diversification between and within NDDs
	- commonalities may suggest that some strategies might have broader applications across the spectrum of NDDs and might be useful for *targeting multiple* shared NDD hallmarks.
	- Despite the similar hallmarks for NDDs, their relative *importance* in the *different diseases* clearly *differs*, likely dictated by genetic and environmental factors as well as by specific neuronal popu- lations, brain regions, or cell types affected.
3. stratification of subtypes within specific NDDs for clinical trials
	- Individual/personalized differences in the primary drivers clearly exist within specific NDDs

		- Younger patients of *this study* with *low* tau levels *might progress* to tau *equivalency* as the disease progresses.
		- total *tau* in the *CSF* in an *MS* population *decreases* over the course of the disease and reflects the degree of *parenchymal实质的 brain loss*. Although in *schizophrenia* there is not a parenchymal loss as seen in MS, *volume reduction* of some regions especially *temporal and frontal lobes* have been shown
	2. and the patients who had **more** previous electroconvulsive 电刺激 therapy (**ECT**) had **higher** serum **total tau** levels.
		- Research exploring the relation of ECT and neurodegeneration that includes CSF tau studies did not reveal significant difference after ECT in depression, so this correlation *may be* explained with probable quite a bit of *damage of ECT* which had done

# 3. APOE
1. **Definition**: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a protein involved in fat metabolism. It is a major component of specific lipoproteins, which are responsible for carrying cholesterol and other fats in the bloodstream. APOE plays a vital role in the normal catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein constituents.
2. **Gene**: The gene that encodes the APOE protein is also called APOE. There are several allelic variants (forms) of the APOE gene, with APOE ε2, ε3, and ε4 being the most common. These allelic variants can influence the function of the protein and have been linked to various health conditions.
**Health Effects**:
1. **Alzheimer's Disease**: 
   - The APOE ε4 allele is the most significant genetic risk factor for sporadic (non-familial) Alzheimer's disease.
   - Individuals with one copy of the ε4 allele have an increased risk, while those with two copies (homozygous) have an even higher risk of developing Alzheimer's.
   - Conversely, the APOE ε2 allele is associated with a decreased risk for Alzheimer's disease.
2. **Cardiovascular Disease**:
   - APOE variants can influence lipid metabolism and, therefore, play a role in cardiovascular diseases. For instance, the APOE ε4 allele has been associated with higher levels of LDL cholesterol, posing a higher risk for coronary heart disease.
   - The APOE ε2 allele, in contrast, is associated with a type of hyperlipoproteinemia, which can lead to the accumulation of cholesterol in the blood but has a protective effect against coronary heart disease.
3. **Other Conditions**:
   - APOE variants have also been studied in the context of other neurological conditions, longevity, and recovery from traumatic brain injury, though results can be variable and sometimes inconclusive.
**Rationale for its Significance**:
1. **Biomarker Potential**: Due to its association with Alzheimer's and cardiovascular disease, APOE genotyping is often used as a biomarker in research settings to identify individuals at risk.
2. **Drug Target**: Understanding APOE's role in disease progression can also help in the development of therapeutic interventions targeting APOE metabolism or function.
3. **Personalized Medicine**: Knowledge about an individual's APOE status can guide personalized health strategies, especially in preventive measures for Alzheimer's disease or cardiovascular conditions.
However, it's essential to note that while the APOE ε4 allele increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease, not everyone with the allele develops the disease. Similarly, not all Alzheimer's patients have the ε4 allele. APOE is a part of a complex interplay of genetics, environment, lifestyle, and other factors influencing disease risk and progression.

The relationship between the APOE gene and dementia risk, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), is one of the most studied genetic associations in neurodegenerative disease research. Here's the rationale behind this relationship:
1. **Genetic Association**:
   - Among the APOE alleles (ε2, ε3, and ε4), the APOE ε4 allele is strongly associated with an increased risk of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Possessing one ε4 allele increases the risk, while having two copies (being homozygous for ε4) significantly amplifies that risk.
   - Conversely, the APOE ε2 allele is associated with a decreased risk of AD.
2. **Brain Amyloid-β (Aβ) Deposition**:
   - Amyloid-β accumulation in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology. Research indicates that the presence of the APOE ε4 allele enhances Aβ deposition in the brain.
   - APOE ε4 promotes the conversion of soluble Aβ to its insoluble form, leading to plaque formation.
3. **Neurofibrillary Tangle Formation**:
   - Beyond its role in amyloid deposition, APOE ε4 has been linked to increased tau pathology, another major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Elevated tau pathology leads to neurofibrillary tangle formation, which contributes to neuronal damage and death.
4. **Neuroinflammation**:
   - APOE ε4 is associated with increased neuroinflammation. Chronic inflammation in the brain exacerbates neurodegenerative processes and may accelerate disease progression in Alzheimer's patients.
5. **Lipid Metabolism**:
   - APOE is involved in lipid transport and metabolism in the brain. Aberrant lipid metabolism, influenced by certain APOE genotypes, can alter neuron function and health, contributing to dementia risk.
6. **Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity**:
   - There's evidence suggesting that the APOE ε4 allele compromises the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, which can lead to increased permeability and subsequent neuronal damage.
**In Summary**:
The rationale for the relationship between APOE and dementia risk lies in the gene's multifaceted role in Alzheimer's pathology. From influencing hallmark features like amyloid-β and tau accumulation to modulating neuroinflammation, lipid metabolism, and blood-brain barrier function, APOE's impact is broad and significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.
However, while APOE ε4 is a risk factor, it's not deterministic. Not everyone with the allele will develop Alzheimer's, indicating that other genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors also play a crucial role in disease onset and progression.
