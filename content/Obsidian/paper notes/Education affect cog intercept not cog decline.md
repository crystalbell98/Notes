# 1. Education and Cognitive Functioning Across the Life Span (2020)
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/Education%20and%20Cognitive%20Functioning%20Across%20the%20Life%20Span.pdf)
[Author's meta paper on education and cog decline](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/Education%20and%20age-related%20decline%20in%20cognitive%20performance-%20Systematic%20review%20and%20meta-analysis%20of%20longitudinal%20cohort%20studies.pdf)
- Declines are important and *vary* across people. It is important to identify *protective factors*.
- Education is positively correlated with cognition *throughout adulthood* and predicts lower risk of dementia
1) impact **intercept** of cognition. 
	1) positive correlation
	2) *reciprocal* relations
	3) *common factors*: parental socioeconomic resources that affect both educational attainment and cognitive development
	4) education-cognition association across *entire life* and across the *full range of education* levels
2) impact **slope** of cognitive decline 
	1) *negligible* and a threshold model of dementia can account for the association between educational attainment and late-life dementia risk
	2) absence of slope impact *limit* the notions of *cognitive reserve*
- Formal, full-time education is usually indexed by education *qualification* (ordinal) or *years* of completed education (interval scale).
	- *ignore* many important predictors, such as *quality* of schooling, the *social context* of schooling, and the status associated with particular *educational credentials*
	- this review of years of education may underestimate for highly enriched educational settings and overestimates for impoverished settings 为什么？ 不理解低估 高教育，高估 低教育，平均化效应吗
- The variable is bounded at a lower level because of *compulsory-education laws*. 
	- This could introduce the "*floor effect*", where it is hard to study the effects of having less than this minimum level of education on cognition.
	- Although not common, a "*ceiling effect*" could occur if a large proportion of individuals achieve the maximum education level available , limiting the ability to study further variability at the higher end of the education spectrum
- Primer on adult ==cognitive development==
	- **Fluid abilities (Gf)**
		- psychomotor speed, memory, and abstract reasoning
		- reflect declarative  陈述的 and procedural 程序的 knowledge 
		- Gf *decline* with advancing age during adulthood, even in the absence of detectable disease. Decline begin in middle age or earlier and accelerate with age
	- **Crystallized abilities (Gc)**
		- vocabulary, literacy, numeracy, knowledge of world history and current events, and specialized domain knowledge and skills
		- Gc *increase* through middle age and are less adversely affected in older age
	- **General intelligence**, Gf and Gc can be summarized by a single common factor
		- Gf and Gc are *moderately correlated* with one another. *differences* between people are relatively *consistent across different cognitive abilities*.
		- correlations among various cognitive domains, it is common for researchers in aging to focus on general cognitive ability
		- general cognitive ability is justified when researching determinants of cognitive function likely to have nonspecific effects, for example, nutrition.
	- **Between-person differences in cognition**
		- **Intercept differences**
			- *becoming* increasingly *stable* over the course of *childhood* and are *highly stable* over extended periods *in middle adulthood*.
		- **Slope differences**
			- differences in cognition have *inconsistent and small* associations *with* subsequent aging-related *cognitive changes*
				- Aging is not kinder to the initially smarter
				- ![[Pasted image 20230802153724.png]]
			- slope differences is *larger in childhood* and *limited during adulthood* until older age
			- Nevertheless, small differences in slope may be quite consequential, given they may continue for several decades
			- *two thirds* of the *variance* in cognitive changes in different cognitive abilities is **shared**
				- changes in highly disparate cognitive abilities are strongly correlated
				- individual differences in cognitive change are *reliable*
				- cognitive aging is a *general phenomenon* that pervades many different domains of cognitive function
				- a *complete mechanistic* account of cognitive aging *cannot* simply focus on *domain-specific* processes
			- **difficult to measure**
				- *Methodological*
					- lower power to detect: smaller variance in *change* and shorter follow-up *time*
				- *Substantive*
					- change variance arise from *random process* that are *difficult to measure* or are rarely measured (eg. human senescence have an inherently random component)
					- although high heritability of cognitive ability, the *heritability* of cognitive change is *modest*
				- SES, genetic, lifestyle, general health, and fitness predictors in a linear model only *account for 16%* of cognitive change in older age, compared with 81 of variance of baseline cognition
	- **Cognitive declines**
		- relationship between cognitive decline and changes in everyday functioning and well-being is not always obvious.
			- shifting to less cognitively complex
			- using abilities that remain relative preserved with age (acquired knowledge)
		- dementia
			- decline in more than one cognitive domain with functional consequences for daily social or occupational activities
			- 70% of all dementia case are diagnosed after age 75
			- Separating normative age-related cognitive changes from disease-related processes is often difficult, especially in the initial phase and at older ages. The diagnosis process is lengthy and requires several examinations during at least a 6- to 12-month period
		- **biomarkers**
			- *weak associations* between *biomarkers* and cognition relevant to everyday *functioning* in the early and *prodromal* phase 
			- identify more *homogeneous clusters* of dementia types and allow for *early identification* of pathology and treatment long before clinical symptoms
- Evidence from ==observational studies==
	- Meta-analyses: Education and levels of **cognitive function** in the general adult population
		- Discussed based on estimates of **linear associations**
			- nonlinear associations can occur
				- *Finishing a degree* may, for example, be associated with important outcomes beyond the continuous effects of time in school.
				- **additional education** may have *diminishing marginal effects* on cognitive ability at higher levels of ability or education
				- given *compulsory-education laws* and common socioeconomic barriers, variation in *cognitive ability* might play *less* of a *role* in *educational attainment* at *lower education levels*, in which mean educational attainment is likely to be closer to the mandated minimum.
					- education~cognition regression underestimate the effect at the lower end of education
						- education is less outcome of cognition
					- *cognition~education* regression *overestimate* the effect at the lower end of education
						- some individuals with the minimum amount of schooling would have ability levels that would otherwise be associated with even less schooling
						- the differences between the minimum compulsory level and the next level education would be larger than such differences between later levels of education
		- **Childhood and early adulthood**
			- general *cognitive ability* from batteries of intelligence tests) in childhood through early adulthood (*3–23 years*)
			- *education* (highest degree attained or years of education) measured later in life (20–78 years). 
			- Fifty-nine samples (total *N = 84,828*)
			- restricted to *Western* populations, predominantly from the United States
			- weighted-average *correlation*, corrected for error in measurement, was **.56** (95% confidence interval (CI] = (0.53, 0.58])
			- The correlation *increased with* the *age* at cognitive assessment, from .42 when intelligence was tested between the ages of 3 and 10 years to .61 when it was tested between the ages of 19 and 23 years
		- **Older adults**
			- 109 studies (total *N = 111,684*)
			- mainly, but *not exclusively*, from *Western* populations
			- For *general cognitive ability* (typically composites across neuropsychological tests), the sample-size weighted-average correlation (not corrected for unreliability) was approximately **.3**.
			- for *episodic memory* and working or short-term memory (both correlations = **.23**) than for measures of (a) *perceptual speed*, (b) *visuospatial ability*, or (c) language abilities (all three correlations were around **.3**)
		- **Factors** that may **affect** the **magnitude** of this association remain unanswered.
			- expect education is *more closely* related to *crystallized* abilities than fluid abilities
			- differences across different abilities may be *confounded* by differences in the *reliability* differences
		- The association is **robust across** factors such as gender, race, society, and birth cohort, although these factors may differentially influence the magnitude of the association
	- Education and aging-related **cognitive changes** in the general population of adults
		- Two approaches to study
			1. **Cross-sectional**: whether the *magnitude* of associations between educational attainment and cognitive ability *differs* systematically with the *age* at which the *abilities are assessed* in adulthood
				- *If* educational attainment is associated with *slower* cognitive *decline*, we would *expect* the association between educational attainment and cognitive ability to *strengthen as a function of age*
				- meta analysis of **young and middle-aged** samples by Strenze (2007) produced a substantially **larger** estimate of the **association** between educational attainment and cognitive ability than the meta-analysis of **older samples** by Opdebeeck et al. (2015).
					- that greater education is associated with faster cognitive declines
						- the neuropsychological tests dominating the data in the analyses by *Opdebeeck* et al. (2015), especially the measures of memory, typically have *lower reliability* (and may therefore indicate weaker associations with education) than the more well-established measures of general ability that were analyzed by Strenze (2007).
						- Moreover, *cohort differences*, age-related changes in variance of cognitive-test scores, age differences in population representativeness, age-related differences in measurement reliability, and other methodological factors (as well as unknown differences between studies) are possible confounds in cross-sectional data.此外，队列差异、年龄相关的认知测试分数方差变化、人口代表性的年龄差异、测量可靠性的年龄相关差异
			2. **Longitudinal**: directly examine whether *educational* attainment is *related* to *inter-individual* differences *in* rates of *intra-individual* cognitive *change* over time
				- Old study has mixed results
					- negative correlation
						- Suthers, & Crimmins, 2007; Gross et al., 2015
					- no correlation
						- Tucker-Drob, Johnson, & Jones, 2009; Zahodne et al., 2011
					- positive correlation
						- Arbuckle, Maag, Pushkar, & Chaikelson, 1998; Lyketsos, Chen, & Anthony, 1999
					- studies *adjusted for baseline* cognition using imperfectly reliable measures, and they often had *only two assessment* waves. 
						- estimation of the effect of variables that are correlated with baseline cognitive performance on change in cognition is *biased*, typically *toward the cross-sectional* association.
						- compares individuals with *different educational* levels but the *same* measured *baseline cognitive* performance. 
							- So, increased likelihood that at the baseline, individuals with more education will show the same performance as individuals with less education *because of errors in measurement*.
							- At follow-up, the less educated individuals will be more likely to regress to the lower mean and the more educated individuals will be more likely to regress to the higher mean, which could *falsely imply* that the *less educated* individuals experienced *greater declines*.
				- Recent evidence showed that the association is *small*, *even over decades*.
					- Over the two decades (*from 60 to 80* years of age) during which cognitive performance shows the most marked decline (Rönnlund et al., 2005), an individual with a *university degree* (5 years of education beyond high school) is expected to experience approximately *0.02 SD* (0.002 × 2 decades × 5 years) *less* overall *decline* than an individual with only a high school diploma. The effect estimated at the upper end of the 95% confidence interval raises that advantage to 0.05 SD. This is rather trivial compared with the average rate of episodic memory *decline*, which has been *estimated* around *0.4 to 0.5 SD per decade* in this period of life (Berggren, Nilsson, & Lövdén, 2018; Rönnlund et al., 2005; Schaie, 1994).
					- Lipnicki et al. (2017): educational attainment had *small* associations with changes in *language* and *processing speed* and *null* associations with changes in *memory* and *executive function*
					- harmonized and analyzed data from 14 longitudinal studies conducted in 12 countries. Each study had 2 to 16 assessment waves (M = 3) and a follow-up duration of 2 to 15 years. A total of 42,170 individuals from 54 to 105 years old were included.
					- Cadar et al., 2017: A *very weak positive association* (i.e., a protective effect) between education and change in memory was also reported in another major recent analysis of *immediate*- and *delayed*-*memory* scores for over 11,000 individuals from 10 countries who were 65 years or older and taking part in the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe.
					- Lövdén (2020) meta analysis: 1 additional year of education and cognitive changes were *very small*
					- less than *0.001 SD per decade* for *episodic memory* (95% CI = (−0.001, 0.002]; Fig. 3) and for reasoning (or fluid ability; 95% CI = (−0.013, 0.013]), 0.002 SD per decade for general intelligence (95% CI = (−0.0003, 0.0051]), 0.002 SD per decade for processing speed (95% CI = (−0.002, 0.005]), −0.004 SD per decade for verbal fluency (95% CI = (−0.009, 0.0001]), and less than −0.001 SD per decade for crystallized ability (95% CI = (−0.004,0.003]). None of these effects was statistically significant, despite the impressive precision of most of the estimates.
		- Heterogeneity across studies, **modifiers**?
			- **Age**
				- *no* strong indication that *effects* of education on cognitive ability are *larger at younger* ages (Berggren et al., 2018).
			- **Education level**
				- *effects* of educational attainment on cognitive change may appear *in* samples of individuals who are *poorly educated*, but *no* such pattern was evident for any cognitive outcome examined in the reviewed meta-analysis.
			- **Point at accelerates**
				- Evidence for effects of *education on points of accelerated* change is *mixed* so far
					- The roles of *factors* such as turning points (e.g., *retirement*), *cohort effects*, and *retest effects* that differ as a function of educational attainment are also *not fully understood*.
				- whether education is associated with the trajectory of cognitive decline or the point at which it accelerates, and it is possible that such analyses may be *more sensitive to effects* of education than analyses that treat change as only linear.
			- **Cognition**
				- focus on normal-range cognition and *exclude dementia*. However, it is likely that individuals in the prodromal phases of pathological decline remained. No study reported the differences of the association between education and cognitive decline
			- **Society depending**
				- the degree of equality in access to tertiary education
				- No such evidence, however, emerged from the reviewed metaanalysis, which showed no association between effect sizes and the Gini coefficient (a commonly used measure of a country’s inequality)
		- Potential biasing effects of mortality and **selective dropout**
			- Higher education associated with longer survival
			- Mortality is a major cause of dropout in longitudinal studies and it is possible that *individuals* who *perish earlier* experience *faster cognitive decline* in their final years than do comparably educated individuals who survive.
				- studies that have attempted to address this issue have *not* reported substantially *altered estimates*
			- the association between educational attainment and cognitive change were related *neither* to participants’ *age* nor to the *length of follow-up*
				- Given that age and length of follow-up would likely be associated with the extent of a bias introduced by selective dropout, these results do *not suggest* that *selective dropout* had a major *influence* on the estimates.
	- Education and **dementia risk**
		- *differences in peak* levels of cognitive function during early adulthood are expected to lead to differences in when cognitive function declines below a *threshold* beyond which daily functioning is substantially impaired.
		- *low educational* attainment is associated with *greater incidence of dementia* at *any age* and, consequently, with an *earlier age* of dementia *diagnosis*.
			- education reduces dementia risk in a *relatively linear dose-response manner*. 
				- However, *few* of the individual studies that were included in the meta-analysis showed a clear dose-response pattern through the *whole range of years of schooling*.
	- Education and cognitive decline **before and after dementia diagnosis**
		- Several studies have investigated whether *education modifies* the progression of *cognitive changes* leading **up to and following** a *dementia* diagnosis.
		- *Violate* the basic **analytic dictate** *not* to *restrict* analyses on the basis of *factors* (dementia) that are *consequences of* the *dependent* variable (cognitive performance).
		- Risk of *education-related ascertainment and diagnostic* **bias** (e.g., differential care-seeking behavior and access to health care may cause some people to be screened or diagnosed at disproportionate rates)
		- **Before** a diagnosis of dementia
			- Five of the studies (total N = 2,156; average N = 431; range = 117–856) reported *faster decline* for more *highly educated* individuals
				- A few studies have reported a *later acceleration but faster decline*
			- Two studies detected *no statistically significant* effect of education on cognitive change
				- Education modified neither the point of accelerated decline before a dementia diagnosis nor the speed of the decline on a measure of general cognition
		- **Surrounding** dementia
			- Study number is limited and their results have been mixed: *faster* cognitive decline for more *highly educated* people and *null effects* of education on cognitive change
				- Two statistical artifacts
					- **Collider bias**
						- situations in which two variables that *jointly determine an outcome* become artifactually correlated (often inversely correlated) in analyses selecting on or *controlling for that outcome*.
						- ![[Pasted image 20230804131628.png|400]] 
						- both peak and slope determine the dementia diagnosis, when selecting dementia, false correlation was introduced between peak and slope.
							- From previous evidence, peak is associated with education level while slope don't. So false correlation between education and slope
					- **Ascertainment timing**
						- refer to when dementia is diagnosed in the process of cognitive decline
						- high education *decline from higher peak* and when they are diagnosed, they tend to be older. If cognitive *declines accelerated* as a *function of age*, then higher education will show faster decline when they are diagnosed
	- level of **cognitive performance** has small and **inconsistent** associations with subsequent **cognitive change**. consistent with education and slope.
	- **Cohort effect**
		- increases in *cognitive performance* across birth cohorts (the so-called *Flynn effect*)
		- *not* been accompanied by consistent birth-cohort effects in *rates of cognitive aging*
		- results are mixed, later-born correlated faster/slower/no difference decline
	- A few prospective **genetic, lifestyle, and general health** and fitness predictors of age-related cognitive change have been identified.
		- Many of these factors are tightly linked to physical health (and chronological age)
			- later-life physical and social activity
			- physical fitness (e.g., walking speed, grip strength)
			- cardiovascular risk factors
		- There are *fewer findings* of robust and sizable associations between factors closely linked with educational attainment (e.g., *socioeconomic conditions*) and longitudinal cognitive *declines*
			- *although* some evidence suggests later-life *socioeconomic* factors may relate to the rate of *memory decline*
		- The *joint predictive power* of those factors that are related to the rate of *cognitive change* is *modest*, especially in *comparison with* their much greater success in accounting for variation in levels of *cognitive performance*
	- **Dementia risk factor**
		- include factors *impact* either *intercept or slope* of cognition
		- **Education** is also likely to play an **indirect role** in several of determinants of dementia: 
			- **genetic** susceptibility, 
				- Whereas *rare variants* of large effect in a few genes such as amyloid β protein precursor (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2) have been implicated in no more than 5% of all cases of Alzheimer’s disease
				- the *aggregate effects* of more *common genetic variants* with individually small effects are relevant for risk for more common, sporadic (non-familial) forms of the disease
				- Estimates from twin studies put the *heritability* of Alzheimer’s disease at around *60%*
				- The apolipoprotein E gene **(APOE) ε4** allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for dementia
					- the effect of the APOE ε4 allele on dementia seems to be strongly **attenuated by** *vascular* health and by many *psychosocial* factors, such as education and mental, physical, and social activity in late life and other psychosocial factors during the entire life span
			- **vascular** burden
			- **psychosocial** and behavioral determinants that operate over the life course
- ==Origins and moderators== of the association between education and adult cognitive ability levels
	- Educational attainment as the outcome of a broad constellation of **environmental factors**
		- parental resources, social support, scholastic opportunities
		- In turn, education may also influence individuals’ own socioeconomic resources and environmental exposures throughout adult life, including by partly determining occupation, social status, *financial* resources, and, directly or indirectly, *access to quality health care*
		- *laws* regulating the *age* at which children could receive a *work permit* predicted the age at which they left school, implicating financial concerns and the opportunity cost of schooling as major drivers of educational attainment
		- Until 1954, the United States had de jure *racial segregation* in the states where most *Blacks* lived, creating profound *barriers to education*, and de facto racial segregation remains common in the United States
	- Educational attainment as an outcome of **individual characteristics**
		- **Traits** influence education
			- cognitive abilities
			- self-efficacy
			- socio-emotional skills
			- personality
			- health
			- well-being
			- perception of one’s school and home environment 对一个人的学校和家庭环境的感知
		- Individual characteristics are outcomes of both *sociocontextual environments* and *genetically* influenced dispositions
			- *socioeconomic* contexts on educational attainment are likely to be partly *mediated* by effects of those *contexts* on the development of *psychological and behavioral* characteristics relevant for both *scholastic performance* and *educational aspirations*
			- In a *meta-analysis* of 15 studies drawn from multiple countries, an *average heritability of 40%* for educational attainment, with substantial heterogeneity among countries and among demographic groups within countries
			- *GWAS* identified *15%* between-persons differences in educational attainment are attributable to unspecified common genetic variants that are reliably measured
		- Between person differences in *education and psychological* correlated is a *moving target*
			- sources of differences vary with *age*, birth *cohort*, period, and *society*
				- society differences and changes within societies over time
			- *increased heritability of education* for Norwegian men born between 1940 and 1949 compared to born before 1940, suggesting a reduced dependency on the socioeconomic environment and an increased dependency on endogenous factors
			- *period effects*, such as changes in the *importance of education* for occupational careers
	- Effects of education on **cognitive development**
		- formal school expose individuals to *more cognitive stimulation and opportunities* to acquire knowledge and skills than alternative activities would.
			- train specific forms of declarative and procedural knowledge: *crystallized cognitive abilities*
			- knowledge is relevant for more *fluid abilities* (memory and reasoning)
				- *stimulates neurobiological change*: greater demands on working memory, reasoning, and declarative memory, which is important for their growth
				- expect effects of education on fluid processing abilities
			- longer education has more exposure but also better quality of opportunity and demands
		- *protect* individuals from *hazards of not being in school*
			- stress of work environment
			- lawbreaking
		- **Meta analyses results**
			- All methods showed *significant positive* results
				- regression-discontinuity
					- age-based cutoffs for entry into formal schooling serve as a means to separate the effects of chronological maturation from the effects of  1 additional year of school
				- controlling for earlier intelligence
				- instrumental variables
			- *studies of policy changes* samples about the effect size of 1 additional year education on cognition
				- 0.14 SD, 2 IQ points
				- local average treatment effects
					- the effects of increasing the duration of education for individuals who *would have otherwise left school* at the minimum compulsory level before the policy change
					- unknown whether the effects of additional years of education after longer durations of schooling
						- likely, as the level of education increases, *schooling has diminishing marginal effects* on cognitive performance
							- because learning follows an asymptotic or diminishing marginal function
							- because people who already had higher levels of education would probably be working in cognitively complex occupations if they were not in school
							- because students benefit less from schooling at older ages because of declines in neurocognitive plasticity
			- meta-analysis of *school-age cutoff* designs produced substantially *larger effect-size* estimates (approximately 5 IQ points per year of education) *than* were produced by the meta-analysis of *policy-change designs* (approximately 2 IQ points per year of education)
				- *school-age* cutoff measured when children were still in the *midst of their education*, **immediate** benefits
				- while *policy change* measured several *years after* individuals had *completed* their education. **long term** effect
				- education effect fade in the initial years and reach a lower asymptote that is maintained into older age
		- **narrower or broader** cognitive ability?
			- education can affect only narrow abilities rather than general intelligence. By conveying narrow skills (cognitive strategies) and knowledge, education could in turn mutually affect many different cognitive abilities.
			- However, intellectual activities (cognitive training, music, and chess) result in narrowed effect that are not transfer well to other cognitive areas that weren't specifically practiced or developed through those activities.
			- The *mutualism model*: mutual causation among the different abilities.
				- not the g factor model: explains that all cognitive abilities are positively correlated with one another because they are all affected by a general ability
				- fluid abilities are invested (e.g., via effortful cognitive processing, such as that which occurs during study) in the acquisition of crystallized knowledge
				- Education may play a fundamental facilitative role in these dynamic processes
		- Are the effects **important to everyday life**
			- possible that these effects are mediated by the effects of education on *test-taking skills* and do *not extend to* functions *outside of the test* situation
			- though other factors correlated with education might mediate the observed positive effects on cognitive performance, prolonged education is associated with at least one outcome that *all* people can *agree* is important: *life expectancy*
	- Dynamic developmental processes: **gene environment**
		- Transactional models posit that individuals differentially *select*, evoke, and attend to environmental *experiences* on the basis of differences in their abilities, interests, and motivations, and that those experiences may *in turn affect* those *traits*, thus both supporting cognitive development and increasing exposure to further environmental experiences relevant for cognitive development
		- the *traits* that lead individuals to differentially select, evoke, and attend to environmental experiences are *partly genetically influenced*, these transactional processes give rise to gene–environment correlations
			- Such active *gene–environment* correlations are expected to *increase* over the course of child development, particularly as *children gain the autonomy* to choose their experiences for themselves
			- *heritability* of cognitive abilities during development, with meta-analyses indicating *increases* from approximately 10% in infancy to approximately 70% by late adolescence
- What Carries the Influence of **Education on Cognition Into Older Age**?
	- affect the *intercept* not the slope, this effect will partly preserved into old age and need continued occupational complex to maintain
	- also, education *increased by policy change* provide *little beneficial* because schooling increases for everyone in a community
	- *social context* may prevent the benefits of additional education: black men in US is extreme racial discriminated and themselves are blocked from many occupational paths despite their education
- Implications for Theories of **Cognitive Aging**
	- We hypothesized that education transmit knowledge and cognitive skills that allow individuals less susceptible to the deleterious effects of brain aging and related pathology
	- The *brain is in synaptic alterations* rather than in macrostructural changes that would be easily detectable with MRI
	- Cognitive reserve concept implies the existence of some crystallized abilities (i.e., knowledge and skills) that can soften the impact of aging-related brain changes on cognitive functioning.
	- The available evidence support the effect on intercept rather than slope
	- Education is more like *brain reserve* rather than compensation or cognitive reserve 

# 2. How Do Cognitively Stimulating Activities Affect Cognition and the Brain Throughout Life(2020)
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/How%20Do%20Cognitively%20Stimulating%20Activities%20Affect%20Cognition%20and%20the%20Brain%20Throughout%20Life.pdf)
- Education and brain pathology
	- **Postmortem** sample: Education is **not** related with brain **pathology**, **but** related with the **clinical diagnosis** before death
	- **PET amyloid** suggests education affect the dynamics of amyloid-β in the brain. 
		- higher education show less amyloid binding on PET, an effect maybe specific for those with APOE
		- higher lifetime cognitive activity showed diminished amyloid binding
		- mixed effects by brain region in Arenaza-Urquijo et al., 2017;
		- lack of effect in Vemuri et al., 2012
	- *Reasons for inconsistence*
		- *imaging* studies reflect something more *temporary* than the postmortem studies. amyloid binding on PET can be affected by just one night of sleep deprivation
	- Future
		- it will be important to see whether the levels of amyloid binding on *PET* show a different rate of *longitudinal change* depending on education or show a consistent relationship with education level regardless of age.
	- It could be that those with higher education require less brain activity to get the same cognitive task done
- brain-training programs clearly improve performance on the brain-training tasks themselves but beyond that show quite limited efficacy, especially when it comes to everyday cognitive performance
- **Later-life interventions** apparently **less successful** than early-life education
	- brain training is simply not as intensive or as engaging as full-time schooling during childhood
	- potential for plasticity may decrease with age
	- cost-benefit equation shift in aging
		- although mental stimulation has many benefits for the brain, it also has metabolic costs
		- education activate the locus ceruleus, which serves as the brain's arousal hub region and focuses attention and working memory in the moment, while also enhancing the likelihood of synaptic changes
		- synaptic activity creates amyloid-β waste
		- In aging, the brain’s waste disposal system tends to be less effective

# 4. Cognitive Reserve, Alzheimer’s Neuropathology, and Risk of Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta‑Analysis (2021)
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/Cognitive%20Reserve%20Alzheimers%20Neuropathology%20and%20Risk%20of%20Dementia%20A%20Systematic%20Review%20and%20Meta‐Analysis.pdf)
- Gap
	- researchers investigating the effect of CR on risk of dementia progression do *not include* measures of *neuropathology* in their assessment, thereby limiting a thorough test of the CR hypothesis (Stern et al., 2020)
	- Although a recent review assessed prospective longitudinal studies to describe the associations between *CR, AD biomarkers, and cognitive/ clinical outcomes* in participants who were cognitively normal at baseline (i.e., preclinical AD-dementia) (Soldan et al. 2018), their focus on how CR was related to multiple outcomes including onset of clinical symptoms of MCI, changes in cognition, and changes in AD biomarkers, precluded a quantitative examination and limited conclusions regarding the effect of CR on dementia progression. 尽管最近的一项综述评估了前瞻性纵向研究，以描述基线认知正常（即临床前 AD 痴呆）的参与者的 CR、AD 生物标志物和认知/临床结果之间的关联（Soldan 等人，2018），但他们的重点是 CR 与多种结果（包括 MCI 临床症状的发作、认知变化和 AD 生物标志物的变化）之间的关系如何，排除了关于 CR 对痴呆进展影响的定量检查和有限的结论。
- Goal
	- assess the extent to which CR is protective against *incident MCI or dementia* after controlling for AD-related structural pathology and biomarkers
	- A second goal was to examine whether operationalizations of CR (residual of cognition after accounting for neuropathology vs. CR proxies like education or occupation) yield different outcomes in terms of the CR-incident dementia relationship
- Results
	- nine articles meta-analysis
	- High CR was related to a *47% reduced* relative risk of MCI or dementia (pooled-hazard ratio: 0.53 (0.35, 0.81]), with *residual based* CR reducing risk by *62%* and *proxy-based* CR by *48%*.
- Discussion
	- General summary
		- Consistent with previous evidence, we found the protective effect of CR beyond pathology. Probably due to dynamic process that imparts neural protection (Stern, 2009)
	- Pros and Cons of different CR measurements
		- CR proxies (education, occupational, leisure activity)
			- Pros
				- it can be the *points of intervention*
				- *easily measured* as self-report measures
				- associated with better cognitive outcomes even when higher pathology are present, *validation of the construct*
			- Cons
				- CR related *other than CR* to impact cognition (better management of health condition)
				- *qualitatively differ* by cohort or geographic region
				- subject to *reverse causation* (early in a clinical diagnosis, withdrawing from social interactions)
				- summative proxy may *miss unique* associations
				- static nature cannot assess the *changes* in CR
		- Residual variance
			- Pros
				- greater validity than proxy
				- account for bias present in individual proxy
				- incorporates both static and dynamic aspects of CR
			- Cons
				- high levels of variation in variables included in its composition, leading to substantial variability between studies
				- often studies do not account for all aspects of neuropathology, include few indicators of structural integrity

1. Multiple outcomes were combined to yield one effect per cognitive domain (separate domains composite) by calculating composites and their variances based on the formulae by Borenstein and colleagues.
	- A correlation of 1 was assumed when forming the composites, because the true correlation between outcomes of the same domain was not accessible from the full-text articles and the assumption of a high dependence represents the conservative approach due to the sole risk of underestimating the precision.
2. Multiple interventions: To assess the overall effect of exercise on general cognitive performance, another composite score was created for each study or subgroup with the same formulae by combining the effect sizes from the different domains (combined domains composite)
	- In a preliminary analysis, the correlation of exercise-induced effects between the domains was calculated across studies, which reported at least two different domains. Based on an average correlation of r = 0.6, composite scores were formed. Although the coefficient calculated across studies only served as a raw estimate of the within-study correlation, this approach still reduces the risk of over- and underestimating the precision.
# 6. White paper Defining and investigating cognitive reserve, brain reserve, and brain maintenance (2020)
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/Whitepaper%20Defining%20and%20investigating%20cognitive%20reserve,%20brain%20reserve,%20and%20brain%20maintenance.pdf)
Reserve is a heuristic 探索的 to help explain individual differences in cognition, function relative to aging and brain disease
- ==Cognitive Reserve==
	- **Definition**
		- *adaptability* of cognitive processes that explain differential susceptibility to brain pathology, which can be supported by functional brain processes (networks)
		- origins from *innate* (in utero or genetically determined) individual differences and *lifetime* exposures (intelligence, education, occupation, physical exercise, leisure activities, or social engagement)
		- is an *active* reserve that dynamic functional brain processes cope with brain changes
		- this functional brain processes may already be present *before* the onset of brain pathologies, when brain changes, this could be individual differences in the need or ability to adapt compensatory functional processes to maintain function
	- **Measures** of CR
		 - **Social-behavioral proxies**
			 - education, IQ, occupational complexity, leisure and physical activity
			 - not imply any *specific functional mechanisms*, rather, they are formative, meaning they attempt to present those experiences that contribute to the development of CR
			 - should be *considered in the context* in which they were originally discovered, the degree to which they might account for individual differences in the relationship between the brain state and cognition
				 - eg. observation that educational attainment is associated with *reduced age-specific risk* of developing Alzheimer’s dementia could suggest that individuals with *higher education* can “*cope with” greater severity* of AD-related brain changes *before becoming demented*.
				 - when biomarker confirm *greater severity of pathology along with relatively preserved functioning* for higher educated. This CR is more justifiable
			- *PRS* of education and intelligence maybe another approach for estimating CR proxy
			- CR is *dynamic* and influenced by *different exposures* across the lifespan, each of component could contribute uniquely to CR. Summary proxies for CR need to take care not to simply identify shared variance among proxies, as this fail to capture the unique contribution and such commonalities might be related to factors other than reserve
			- When there is evidence for a CR proxy, further understanding of whether the proxy is a *causal factor* or reflective of reverse causation is important. For example, *engagement in cognitive activities* could be results of disease status.
		 - **Residual approaches**
			 - Cognition variance not explained by known brain predictors
			 - Shortage
				 - *depend* on predictors and outcomes, vary study from study
				 - brain predictors may only capture *partial* underlying brain pathology
				 - including may things *other than* reserve
			- Advantages
				- more *direct* measurement
				- potentially *dynamic*
		 - **Functional imaging approaches**
			 - functional imaging of brain networks (*resting* state or task-related functional *activation*)
			 - validation
				 - their expression is associated with typical *proxies*
				 - *moderates* the effect of brain changes on cognition
			- Pros
				- more *direct* measure
			- Cons
				- activation network maybe *specific* to given tasks and also dependent on the specific brain regions
					- *Across* multiple tasks or generic resting networks
						- generic resting work may not provide a *complete* explanation of CR
							- CR is working through neuronal processing that *cannot* be captured by functional imaging
								- flexible connections
								- greater dynamic range or responsivity 响应率
	- **Research of CR**
		- Include *three component*
			- status of brain
			- cognitive performance outcome
			- measure of reserve
		- CR *moderates* the relationship between pathology and cognition is a stronger evidence than
			- Simply associated with cognition after controlling for brain pathology. CR simply adds protection beyond pathology
				- CR and cognition association alone cannot prove how that influence the relationship between pathology and cognition
		- *Mechanism*
			- preexisting network
				- efficiency: the degree to which a given task-related brain network must become activated to accomplish a given task
				- capacity: the maximum degree to which a task-related brain network can be activated to keep performing a task in the face of increasing demands
				- flexibility: the networks that can be invoked to perform a task
			- emerging network in response to brain aging or pathology
				- compensation: In response to these brain changes, individuals may recruit brain structures or networks (and thus cognitive strategies) not normally used by individuals with “intact” brains.
- ==Brain Reserve==
	- Definition
		- neurobiological *capital* (number of neurons, synapses), structural characteristic of the brain, macroscopic construct not linked to mechanisms of finer granularity
		- *fixed* construct at any time point, BM of life experience can add to BR
		- *passive* form of reserve that does not invoke active adaptation
		- current definition of CR and BR are made at qualitatively different levels and tend to map onto *different tech* (structural and functional methods)
	- Measurement
		- all structural aspects of the brain that could be measured using in vivo or postmortem techniques, but exclusive of neuropathology.
			- challenges: pathology and BR can be expressed in the same brain areas
		- proxies
			- peak or premorbid brain volume
				- *intracranial volume*, which is not changed
					- gray matter volume
					- cortical surface area
					- cortical thickness
					- white matter microstructural properties
				- *head circumference*
- ==Brain maintenance==
	- Definition
		- genetics or lifestyle can influence age-related brain changes and pathology
		- BM represents the process of maintaining whereas BR represents the status of the brain at a point in time
		- Better BM could thus sustain higher BR
	- Measurement
		- CR proxies that change with time
			- cognitive and leisure activity

# 7. To what degree is late life cognitive decline driven by age-related neuropathologies?
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/To%20what%20degree%20is%20late%20life%20cognitive%20decline%20driven%20by%20age%20related%20neuropathologies.pdf)
The abstract describes a study focused on the impact of various neuropathologies on cognitive decline in the ageing brain. The study aimed to understand how different pathological conditions contribute to cognitive decline in old age. Here's a summary of the key points:

- **Objective**: The study sought to determine the extent to which cognitive decline in older individuals is driven by a range of neuropathologies beyond the well-studied conditions like Alzheimer's disease, infarcts, and Lewy bodies.

- **Participants and Methodology**: The researchers examined data from deceased participants (n = 1164) who had undergone regular cognitive evaluations and brain autopsies as part of two longitudinal studies. The study considered 11 pathological indices, including markers of Alzheimer's disease, non-Alzheimer's neurodegenerative diseases (like LATE-NC, hippocampal sclerosis, Lewy bodies), and cerebrovascular conditions (infarcts, microinfarcts, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis).

- **Cognitive Decline**: On average, cognition declined by around 0.10 unit per year, but there was significant variability in the rates of decline among individuals.

- **Neuropathological Associations**: When considered separately, 10 out of the 11 pathological indices were linked to faster cognitive decline, explaining between 2% and 34% of the variation in decline. When taken together, all 11 indices accounted for 43% of the variation in cognitive decline. *Alzheimer's disease-related indices* explained 30-36% of the variation, non-Alzheimer's neurodegenerative indices explained 4-10%, and cerebrovascular indices explained 3-8%.

- **Onset and Rates of Decline**: The combined 11 pathological indices accounted for less than a third of the variation in the onset of terminal cognitive decline (28%), and the rates of preterminal (32%) and terminal (19%) cognitive decline.

- **Complexity of Cognitive Ageing**: The study concluded that while age-related neuropathologies do play a significant role in late-life cognitive decline, a substantial portion of the variation in cognitive decline remains unexplained even after accounting for a wide range of neuropathologies.

- **Implications**: The findings emphasize the intricate nature of cognitive ageing and have important implications for the development of therapies and treatment targets to address cognitive decline in older individuals.

In summary, the study underscores the complexity of cognitive ageing, showing that while various neuropathologies contribute to cognitive decline, there is still a significant amount of unexplained variability in the decline process. This has implications for the development of effective treatments and interventions for cognitive decline in the elderly.

# 8. Relation of neuropathology with cognitive decline among older persons without dementia
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/Relation%20of%20neuropathology%20with%20cognitive%20decline%20among%20older%20persons%20without%20dementia.pdf)
The objective of this study was to understand how neuropathologies related to the most common causes of dementia (Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, and Lewy body disease) are connected to cognitive decline among older individuals without dementia. The study involved 467 deceased participants without dementia, and the relationship between neuropathological factors and cognitive decline was examined.

- **Participants and Methods**: The study included 467 individuals who had not been diagnosed with dementia. They underwent annual cognitive evaluations and postmortem neuropathological examinations. Neuropathological measures for Alzheimer's disease (amyloid load, tangle density), cerebrovascular disease (macroscopic infarcts, microinfarcts), and Lewy body disease (neocortical Lewy bodies) were quantified.

- **Findings**:
  - 82% of individuals without dementia had amyloid deposits, 100% had tangles, 29% had macroscopic infarcts, 25% had microinfarcts, and 6% had neocortical Lewy bodies.
  - Global cognition declined by an average of 0.034 unit per year.
  - Individual analyses revealed that *amyloid, tangles, and neocortical Lewy bodies* were associated with an increased rate of global cognitive decline, while macroscopic and microinfarcts were not.
  - When considered together, amyloid, tangles, and neocortical Lewy bodies continued to show associations with global cognitive decline.
  - Alzheimer's disease measures were linked to declines in specific cognitive abilities, including episodic memory, semantic memory, and working memory.
  - Lewy bodies were associated with declines in semantic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed.

- **Conclusion**: The study concludes that the neuropathologies commonly associated with dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease and neocortical Lewy body disease, are connected to declines in multiple cognitive abilities among older individuals who did not have a dementia diagnosis.

In summary, the research suggests that Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease, along with certain neuropathological factors, play a role in cognitive decline among older individuals without a diagnosis of dementia. This information provides insights into the complex relationship between neuropathologies and cognitive changes in the absence of overt dementia symptoms.

# 9. Relation of Neuropathology to Cognition in Persons Without Cognitive Impairment
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/EducationCog/Relation%20of%20Neuropathology%20to%20Cognition%20in%20Persons%20Without%20Cognitive%20Impairment.pdf)
The study aimed to investigate the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, cerebral infarcts, Lewy body (LB) pathology, and cognitive abilities in individuals without cognitive impairment. The research involved participants from two aging cohort studies who underwent clinical evaluations and post-mortem assessments.

- **Participants and Methods**: The study involved individuals without dementia from two aging cohort studies. These participants underwent annual clinical evaluations and agreed to brain donation upon death. The study included 296 individuals who didn't have cognitive impairment during their lifetime. Neuropsychological tests were conducted to assess cognitive abilities across various domains.

- **Neuropathology Measures**: The researchers measured AD pathology using a global score, as well as amyloid load and PHFtau tangle density. Cerebral infarcts (macroscopic and microscopic) and Lewy body pathology were also quantified.

- **Findings**:
  - Almost all participants had AD pathology, with more than three-quarters exhibiting amyloid accumulation.
  - A significant portion had cerebral infarctions (both macroscopic and microscopic) and LB pathology.
  - The global AD pathology score was related to overall cognitive function.
  - Amyloid load was linked to global cognitive function, with a trend for tangle density.
  - In terms of specific cognitive domains:
    - AD pathology, PHFtau tangles, and macroscopic infarctions were related to episodic memory.
    - AD pathology and amyloid load were associated with working memory.
  - Further analyses using specific measures of amyloid and tangles yielded stronger connections between global cognition, episodic memory, and these measures.

- **Conclusion**: The study concludes that *AD pathology and macroscopic infarctions* are common among older individuals without cognitive impairment. These factors are linked to episodic memory and working memory, which are components of cognitive abilities.

In summary, the research indicates that AD pathology and macroscopic infarctions are prevalent in individuals without cognitive impairment and are associated with specific cognitive functions such as episodic memory and working memory. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between neuropathological factors and cognitive abilities in individuals who are not exhibiting cognitive deficits.
