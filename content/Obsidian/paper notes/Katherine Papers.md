# The Long-Term Course of Remission and Recovery in Psychotic Disorders 
Cross-sectional estimates of remission and recovery vary widely. A recent meta-analysis of longitudinal first-episode psychosis cohorts estimated 38% of individuals recover (range 14.9%-49.2%), and 58% of individuals remit (range 26.7%-93.9%) (Lally et al., 2017). Some general trends can be observed that explain the wide variation in rates of remission and recovery. Rates of both **remission and recovery were slightly higher among individuals with affective psychosis**, relative to individuals with **nonaffective psychosis**. The length of follow-up did not predict rates of recovery or remission, but there were relatively few studies with a follow-up greater than 10 years. Among the 22 studies with follow-ups 10 years or longer, rates of remission and recovery were more consistent. In a cohort of individuals with non-affective psychosis established in Norway, 50.5% of individuals were considered in symptomatic remission at a 10-year follow-up assessment (Hegelstad et al., 2012). A similar rate was observed in a 12-year follow up of individuals with both affective and non-affective psychoses (60.2% Hill et al., 2012). In a recent 20-year follow-up of a first-episode psychosis cohort, 65% were in remission (O’Keeffe et al., 2022). Rates of recovery have generally been lower. A small study of individuals with schizophrenia in Bali observed only a 23.7% recovery rate 17 years after first admission (Kurihara et al., 2011), while the 20-year follow-up described above estimated a 35.2% rate of recovery (O’Keeffe et al., 2022). 对缓解和恢复的横断面估计差异很大。最近对纵向首发精神病队列的荟萃分析估计38%的个体恢复（范围14.9%-49.2%），58%的个体缓解（范围26.7%-93.9%）（Lally等人，2017年）。可以观察到一些一般趋势，解释缓解率和恢复率的巨大差异。情感性精神病患者的缓解率和恢复率均略高于非情感性精神病患者。随访时间长度不能预测恢复率或缓解率，但随访时间超过10年的研究相对较少。在22项随访10年或更长时间的研究中，缓解率和恢复率更为一致。在挪威建立的患有非情感性精神病的个体队列中，在10年随访评估时，50.5%的个体被认为症状缓解（Hegelstad等人，2012年）。在对情感性和非情感性精神病患者的12年随访中观察到相似的发生率（60.2%Hill等人，2012年）。在最近20年的首次发作精神病队列的随访中，65%处于缓解中（O'Keeffe等人，2022年）。恢复率一般较低。在巴厘岛对精神分裂症患者进行的一项小型研究发现，首次入院17年后的恢复率仅为23.7%（Kurihara等人，2011年），而上述20年随访估计恢复率为35.2%（O'Keeffe等人，2022年）。Knowing the proportion of individuals in remission and recovery at any given point following illness onset is useful for understanding population-level trends. However, population averages may obscure meaningful differences between individuals. If, for example, rates of remission are 50% at 10, 15, and 20 years after illness onset, but this reflects half of the population being continuously symptomatic, and the other in complete remission, no individual is described well by the group averages. To understand common individual trajectories of remission and recovery, longitudinal analyses are needed. 了解发病后任何给定时间点缓解和恢复的个体比例有助于理解人群水平的趋势。然而，群体平均值可能会掩盖个体之间有意义的差异。例如，如果疾病发作后10年、15年和20年的缓解率为50%，但这反映了一半的人群持续有症状，另一半完全缓解，那么没有一个人能很好地用组平均值来描述。为了了解缓解和恢复的共同个体轨迹，需要进行纵向分析。In 1980, Ciompi reported the first such analysis, dividing a sample of individuals with schizophrenia into 8 discrete symptom trajectories, varying in terms of mode of onset, course, and end state, (Ciompi & Clemens, 1980).1 The four groups accounting for a plurality of individuals were an undulating course, in which psychotic episodes were interspersed with periods of symptom remission, tending towards a good outcome (49%), a chronic course of continual symptoms (12%), an undulating course tending towards a poor outcome, with fewer periods of complete remission between episodes over time (9%), and a course of gradual recovery (24%). A report based on 15-year follow-up data from the DOSMeD study (Harrison et al., 2001) sorted participants into the same trajectory-based groups, finding a somewhat higher proportion of individuals in trajectories with good outcomes than Ciompi (60% with periodic episodes and a good outcome, 14% with a gradual recovery), likely attributable to the ascertainment of samples from the developing world. In an epidemiologically-ascertained sample of individuals seeking treatment for the first time from inpatient and outpatient facilities from the greater London area, an undulating course with good outcome described 65% of the cohort, as of the 10-year follow-up. An additional 22% had continuous symptoms with a poor outcome, 11% an undulating course with poor outcome, and 2% a course of gradual recovery (Morgan et al., 2014). 在1980年，**Ciompi报道了第一个**这样的*分析*，将精神分裂症个体样本分为**8个离散的症状轨迹**，在发病模式、病程和终末状态方面各不相同。（Ciompi & Clemens，1980）四组占多数的个体是一个起伏的过程，其中精神病发作与症状缓解期交替，倾向于良好的结果（49%），连续症状的慢性过程（12%），倾向于不良结果的起伏过程，随着时间的推移发作之间完全缓解的时间较少（9%），以及逐渐恢复的过程（24%）。一份基于DOSMeD研究15年随访数据的报告（Harrison等人，2001）将参与者分为相同的轨迹组，发现轨迹组中有良好结局的个体比例略高于Ciompi组（60%有周期性发作和良好结局，14%有逐渐恢复），这可能归因于对发展中国家样本的确定。在大伦敦地区首次从住院和门诊机构寻求治疗的个体的流行病学确定样本中，截至10年随访，65%的队列描述了具有良好结局的波动过程。另外22%的患者具有预后不良的持续症状，11%的患者具有预后不良的波动病程，2%的患者具有逐渐恢复的病程（Morgan等人，2014年）。Two other first-episode cohorts, following individuals for 10 (Austin et al., 2013) and 15 years post-onset (Harrow, 2005), have also reported data on individual trajectories of recovery in psychotic disorders. In the OPUS cohort, an epidemiologically ascertained first-episode psychosis sample from the Netherlands, relatively stable rates of remission and recovery were observed across 2-, 5- and 10-year follow-ups. 22-25% of individuals were remitted and 14-17% recovered at any given time point (Austin et al., 2013). While most individuals experienced remission at least once in the follow up, and 30% experienced recovery, only a minority of individuals stayed remitted or recovered in consecutive time points. In the Chicago Follow-Up Study cohort (Harrow, 2005), similar rates of recovery were observed across 2-, 4.5, 7.5, 10-, and 15-year follow-ups, ranging from 10-22% in schizophrenia and 20-43% in other psychotic disorders. As in the OPUS cohort, Harrow showed that 41% of those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ) and 67% people with other psychoses (OP) had a period of recovery at some point during their illness. However, stable periods of recovery were less common. 另外两个首次发病队列，对个体进行了10次随访（Austin等人，2013年）和发病后15年（Harrow，2005年），也报告了精神障碍个体康复轨迹的数据。在OPUS队列中，一个来自荷兰的经流行病学证实的首发精神病样本，在2年、5年和10年随访中观察到相对稳定的缓解率和恢复率。22 - 25%的个体在任何给定的时间点缓解并且14 - 17%恢复（Austin等人，2013年）。虽然*大多数个体在随访中至少出现一次缓解*，30%出现恢复，但只有少数个体在连续时间点保持缓解或恢复。在芝加哥随访研究队列（Harrow，2005）中，在2年、4.5年、7.5年、10年和15年随访中观察到相似的恢复率，范围为精神分裂症10 - 22%和其他精神疾病20 - 43%。与OPUS队列研究一样，Harrow研究显示，41%的精神分裂症谱系障碍（SZ）患者和67%的其他精神病（OP）患者在患病期间的某个时间点有一段恢复期。然而，稳定的恢复期并不常见。

While each of these studies inform our understanding of long-term remission and recovery in psychotic disorders, they have some limitations. The OPUS and AESOP cohorts have been followed for a relatively short period of time—the average OPUS participant was 36 years old as of the last follow-up (Austin et al., 2013). The Chicago Follow-Up spanned another five years in the illness course, but is not an epidemiologically ascertained sample. The DOSMeD cohort also spanned 15 years, but remission was defined qualitatively, rather than quantitatively. Finally, while Ciompi’s landmark study (Ciompi & Clemens, 1980) spanned 37 years of illness, the sample was evaluated retrospectively, and course was determined qualitatively. 虽然这些研究中的每一项都有助于我们理解精神障碍的长期缓解和恢复，但它们都有一些局限性。OPUS和AESOP队列的随访时间相对较短-截至末次随访时，OPUS参与者的平均年龄为36岁（Austin等人，2013年）。芝加哥随访跨越了另外五年的病程，但不是流行病学确定的样本。DOSMeD队列也跨越了15年，但缓解是定性的，而不是定量的。最后，Ciompi的里程碑式研究（Ciompi & Clemens，1980）跨越了37年的疾病，对样本进行了回顾性评价，并定性地确定了病程。The present study characterizes longitudinal patterns of remission and recovery in a first admission sample, assessed at 6 follow-up points (6-month, 24-month, 48-month, 10-year, 20-year, 25year) over the 25 years following first-admission. The sample was epidemiologically ascertained from all inpatient psychiatric units in Suffolk County, New York. Out of 628 participants at baseline, 341 (68% of  survivors) were successfully recontacted at the 25-year follow-up. Remission and recovery are operationalized using Andreasen’s (2005) and Lieberman’s (2005) definitions, respectively. We compare patterns or remission and recovery between those with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, in order to describe the most common trajectories of illness course among those with psychotic disorders.  本研究描述纵向模式缓解和恢复的第一个承认样品,评估后续6点(6个月、24个月、48-month, 10年,20年,25年)25年来首次承认。所有住院精神病患者的临床流行病学样本确定单位在萨福克县,纽约。在基线,共发出问卷628份,其中341(68%的幸存者)成功勘查在25年的随访。缓解和恢复实施使用安德瑞森利伯曼(2005)和(2005)的定义,分别。我们比较模式或缓解和恢复之间与精神分裂症和其他精神病,为了描述疾病的最常见的轨迹过程中精神障碍。

Participants are members of the Suffolk County Mental Health Project, a longitudinal study of first-admission psychosis patients. Participants were recruited from the 12 inpatient facilities in Suffolk County, New York between 1989 and 1995. Response rate for the baseline assessment was 72%. Eligibility criteria included first admission within the past 6 months, ages between 15 and 60, current psychosis, no apparent medical cause for psychotic symptoms, ability to understand assessment procedures in English, a baseline IQ higher than 70, and a capacity to provide informed consent. The Stony Brook University Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects approved the study annually. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants, or from the parents of participants aged 15 to 17 years. A total of 628 study participants met the inclusion criteria. In-person follow-up interviews were conducted at 6 months, 24 months, 48 months, 10 years, 20 years, and 25 years after baseline (Bromet et al., 1992). At the 25-year follow-up, 341 participants were successfully recontacted. Of the 287 not included, 126 passed away before the follow-up and 161 could not be reached. Of the 341 who were recontacted, recovery could not be evaluated for 28, and remission could not be determined for 24, due to incomplete data. 参与者是萨福克郡心理健康项目的成员，这是一项对首次入院的精神病患者进行的纵向研究。1989年至1995年间，从纽约萨福克郡的12个住院机构招募了参与者。**基线评估的缓解率为72%。入选标准包括在过去6个月内首次入院**，年龄在15 - 60岁之间，目前患有精神病，精神病症状无明显医学原因，能够理解英语评估程序，基线IQ高于70，以及能够提供知情同意书。石溪大学人类受试者研究委员会每年批准这项研究。从所有研究参与者或15 - 17岁参与者的父母获得书面知情同意书。共有628名研究参与者符合入选标准。在基线后6个月、24个月、48个月、10年、20年和25年进行面对面随访访谈（Bromet等人，1992年）。*在25年随访时，341例参与者成功再次联系。在未纳入的287例中，126例在随访前死亡，161例无法联系到。在再次联系的341人中，由于数据不完整，28人无法评估恢复情况，24人无法确定缓解情况*。

Table 1 reports the demographic characteristics the full cohort of 628 participants—referred to as the baseline sample—and the 25-year follow-up of 321 participants—referred to as the 25-year subsample. Analyses were performed in the baseline sample of 628 individuals, as well as 25-year subsample recovery and remission status were known (N=313 and 317, respectively). Those who were in  the 25-year subsample tended to be younger at both age of onset and baseline assessment, reflecting age-related mortality in this cohort. The two groups did not differ in terms of race, gender, or socioeconomic status. 表1报告了628名参与者的整个队列（称为基线样本）和321名参与者的25年随访（称为25年子样本）的人口统计学特征。在628例个体的基线样本中进行了分析，并且已知25年子样本的恢复和缓解状态（分别为N = 313和317）。25岁亚组的患者在发病年龄和基线评估时均倾向于更年轻，反映了该队列中年龄相关的死亡率。两组在种族、性别或社会经济地位方面没有差异

Diagnoses were made by a consensus of study psychiatrists based on all available data at the baseline, 6-month, 24-month, 10-year, and 20-year follow-up assessments. Information was gathered from an interview consisting of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID) and the semistructured Quality of Life Scale (QLS, medical records, and a semi-structured collateral interview)(First & Gibbon, 2004; Heinrichs et al., 1984). Participants were grouped into schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and schizophreniform disorders) and other psychotic disorders (bipolar disorder with psychosis, major depression with psychosis, drug induced psychotic disorder, and other psychotic disorders). Analyses of the baseline sample use the consensus diagnosis made at baseline. Analyses of the 25-year subsample use the most recent consensus diagnosis. 根据基线、6个月、24个月、10年和20年随访评估的所有可用数据，由研究精神科医生一致做出诊断。信息收集自包括DSM IV结构化临床访谈（SCID）和半结构化生活质量量表（QLS、病历和半结构化附带访谈）的访谈（First & Gibbon，2004;海因里希斯等人，1984年）。受试者被分为精神分裂症谱系障碍（精神分裂症、分裂情感性障碍和分裂样障碍）和其他精神障碍（双相情感障碍伴精神病、重性抑郁症伴精神病、药物诱导的精神障碍和其他精神障碍）。基线样本分析使用基线时做出的共识诊断。对25年子样本的分析使用了最新的共识诊断。

Socioeconomic status was operationalized using the Hollingshead index of occupational status, which is rated on a scale from 1 (“large business owner/major professional/executive”) to 8 (“not working”). A participant’s status was quantified as the occupational of the primary income earner of the participant’s family. Race is based on participant’s self-report. 社会经济状况是用霍林斯黑德职业状况指数来衡量的，该指数的等级从1（“大企业主/主要专业人员/行政人员”）到8（“不工作”）。参与人的地位被量化为参与人家庭主要收入来源的职业。人种基于受试者的自我报告。

## Remission
Symptom remission was operationalized using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS)(Andreasen, 1984, 1989). Symptoms are rated based on their severity over the past month. Both scales range from 0 to 5,  where 0=no symptom, 2=mild, and 5=severe. A rating of 2 or less on all of the following symptoms was required for a participant to be considered remitted: **hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior, formal thought disorder, affective flattening, alogia, avolition-apathy, and anhedonia-asociality**. 使用阳性症状评估量表（SAPS）和阴性症状评估量表（SANS）（Andreasen，1984，1989）评估症状缓解。根据过去一个月的严重程度对症状进行评级。两个量表的范围均为0 - 5，其中0 =无症状，2 =轻度，5 =重度。受试者以下所有症状的评分均需为2或更低，方可视为缓解：幻觉、妄想、怪异行为、形式思维障碍、情感扁平化、失语症、无意志-冷漠和快感缺乏-社会性。


## Recovery
Recovery was operationalized using eight variables on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (Overall & Gorham, 1962) and two variables on the Quality of Life Scale (QLS)(Heinrichs et al., 1984). Symptoms are rated based on their severity over the past month. For a participant to be recovered, they had to have scores of 4 or less (moderate or better) on BPRS ratings of conceptual disorganization, mannerisms and posturing, grandiosity, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, unusual thought content, blunted affect, and emotional withdrawal. Participants also had to have a score of 3 or higher on the QLS rating of social activity, where 0=virtually absent, 2= occasional social activity, 4=some regular social activity, and 6=adequate social activity. Participants also had to be rated 3 or higher on the QLS rating of accomplishment, where 0=attempted no role function, 2=functioning just well enough to keep their position, 3=generally adequate functioning, and 6=very good functioning. If there was not enough information to complete the QLS rating of accomplishment, but the individual was either employed at least part-time, or a full-time student, they were considered to be occupationally recovered. 使用简明精神病评定量表（BPRS）（Overall & Gorham，1962）上的8个变量和生活质量量表（QLS）上的2个变量（Heinrichs等人，1984年）。根据过去一个月的严重程度对症状进行评级。要使受试者康复，他们的BPRS评分必须为4分或更低（中度或更好），包括概念混乱、举止和姿态、浮夸、多疑、幻觉行为、不寻常的思想内容、情感迟钝和情感退缩。受试者的社会活动QLS评分也必须为3分或以上，其中0 =几乎没有，2 =偶尔有社会活动，4 =一些定期社会活动，6 =充分的社会活动。参与者还必须在QLS成绩评定中被评为3分或更高，其中0 =尝试不发挥角色功能，2 =功能刚刚好，足以保持其职位，3 =功能基本足够，6 =功能非常好。如果没有足够的信息来完成QLS成绩评级，但该个体至少兼职工作，或全职学生，则认为其职业恢复。

A primary aim of this study was to describe longitudinal patterns of remission and recovery over the 25 years following first admission. As missing data would prevent the grouping people into common longitudinal patterns, missing data were imputed. The ratings on which remission and recovery are based (see above) were imputed using the same ratings from other time points, as well as ethnicity, gender, age at the point of assessment, age at first psychotic symptom, and socioeconomic status.  Imputation was conducted in SPSS using Multivariate imputation by chained equations (van Buuren, 2018), also known as sequential regression imputation, fully conditional specification, or Gibbs sampling. In the MICE algorithm, a chain of regression equations is used to impute ratings one by one, using information from all other variables in the model. Five imputation datasets were generated, ratings were averaged across imputations, and remission and recovery were calculated from the imputed data. For those participants who have died over the follow-up interval, data were not imputed for timepoints following death. Supplemental Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics of raw and imputed data, which did not differ significantly at any time point. 本研究的主要目的是描述首次入院后25年内缓解和恢复的纵向模式。由于缺失数据会妨碍将人群分组为常见的纵向模式，因此对缺失数据进行插补。使用其他时间点的相同评级以及种族、性别、评估时的年龄、首次出现精神病症状时的年龄和社会经济地位，对缓解和恢复所基于的评级（见上文）进行插补。在SPSS中使用链式方程的多变量插补（货车Buuren，2018）进行插补，也称为序贯回归插补、完全条件规范或Gibbs抽样。在MICE算法中，使用模型中所有其他变量的信息，使用一系列回归方程逐个估算评级。生成了5个插补数据集，对各插补的评分取平均值，并根据插补数据计算缓解和恢复。对于随访期间死亡的受试者，未插补死亡后时间点的数据。补充表1报告了原始数据和插补数据的描述性统计量，在任何时间点均无显著差异。

## Results
All analyses were replicated in two samples: baseline sample of 628 participants, and the 25year subsample of 321 participants. Analyses were replicated in order to better understand prospective trajectories of remission and recovery following first admission, as well as long-term patterns of remission and recovery among those observed into late adulthood. Diagnoses are unstable in the period surrounding first-onset (Bromet et al., 2011). The analyses of the baseline sample and diagnoses inform our understanding of prognosis at first onset, while analyses of those observed in the 25-year subsample account for transitions between diagnostic categories that occur early on in the illness course. Cross-sectional rates of remission and recovery in baseline sample of 628 individuals are reported in the left side of Table 2. Among those ascertained at first admission, 39% of those with other psychotic disorders and 24% of those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were recovered 6 months after first admission. However, rates tended to decline over time, and at the end of the 25-year followup, only 19% of those with other psychotic disorders and 9% of those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were in recovery. Rates of remission followed a very similar trajectory, beginning at approximately 40% in other psychotic disorders and 20% in schizophrenia, and falling to 14 and 6%, respectively. 在两个样品中重复所有分析：628名参与者的基线样本和321名参与者的25年子样本。为了更好地了解首次入院后缓解和恢复的前瞻性轨迹，以及观察到成年后期的缓解和恢复的长期模式，重复了分析。在首次发病前后的时间段内，诊断不稳定（Bromet et al.，2011年）。对基线样本和诊断的分析为我们了解首次发病时的预后提供了信息，而对25年子样本中观察到的结果的分析说明了病程早期发生的诊断类别之间的转换。628名个体的基线样本中的缓解和恢复的横断面率报告于表2的左侧。在首次入院时确诊的患者中，39%的其他精神障碍患者和24%的精神分裂症谱系障碍患者在首次入院后6个月恢复。然而，随着时间的推移，发病率呈下降趋势，在25年随访结束时，只有19%的其他精神障碍患者和9%的精神分裂症谱系障碍患者恢复。缓解率遵循一个非常相似的轨迹，其他精神疾病约为40%，精神分裂症约为20%，分别下降到14%和6%。

Cross-sectional rates of remission and recovery among those observed in the 25-year subsample are reported in the right half of Table 2. Among those with schizophrenia in this subsample, crosssectional rates of remission and recovery were somewhat higher, but generally similar to those observed in the full cohort. At any given point within the first decade of illness, approximately one quarter of those with schizophrenia were remitted. Among those with other psychotic disorders individuals observed in the 25-year subsample were more likely to be remitted or recovered at any given time point, compared to the baseline cohort. These differences do not appear to be attributable to attrition, as imputed data are not significantly different from raw data (see Supplemental Table 1), but to diagnostic shifts between baseline and the 25-year follow-up. These trends are depicted in ==Figure 1.== In general, at any given time point, more participants leave a state of recovery or remission than enter one, such that by the 25-year follow-up, overall rates of remission and recovery are quite low. 在25年亚组样本中观察到的横断面缓解率和恢复率见表2右半部分。在这个亚组样本中，精神分裂症患者的横断面缓解率和恢复率略高，但总体上与全队列中观察到的相似。在患病的前十年内，大约有四分之一的精神分裂症患者得到缓解。与基线队列相比，在25年子样本中观察到的其他精神障碍患者在任何给定时间点更有可能缓解或恢复。由于插补数据与原始数据无显著差异（见补充表1），这些差异似乎并非归因于损耗，而是归因于基线与25年随访之间的诊断变化。这些趋势如图1所示。一般而言，在任何给定的时间点，离开恢复或缓解状态的参与者多于进入恢复或缓解状态的参与者，因此到25年随访时，总体缓解率和恢复率相当低。

Patterns of remission and recovery were identified using upset plots, which are reported in Supplemental Figure 1. Upset plots depict the most common patterns of recovery and remission across time points, organized by the frequency of those patterns. Four common patterns were identified : 使用扰乱图确定缓解和恢复模式，见补充图1。扰乱图描述了各时间点最常见的恢复和缓解模式，按这些模式的频率组织。确定了四种常见模式：
1. Continuous remission/recovery: participants who were remitted or recovered across all observed time points. 1.持续缓解/恢复：在所有观察时间点缓解或恢复的受试者。
2. No remission/recovery: participants who were not remitted or recovered at any observed time points. 2.无缓解/恢复：在任何观察时间点均未缓解或恢复的受试者。
3. Early remission/recovery: participants who had a period of remission or recovery in the four years following first admission, but no period of remission/recovery in the following 21 years. 3.早期缓解/恢复：在首次入院后4年内有缓解期或恢复期，但在随后21年内无缓解期/恢复期的参与者。
4. Other: participants not falling into groups 1-3. 4.其他：不属于第1-3组的受试者。

Table 3 summarizes the patterns of remission and recovery among those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (left) and other psychotic disorders (right). The most common pattern in the baseline sample, among those with schizophrenia, was a trajectory of no remission and no recovery. This was also the modal pattern among those with schizophrenia observed in the 25-year subsample. Among the baseline sample of those with psychotic disorders, the modal pattern was one of intermittent remission and recovery. The same pattern was the observed in the 25-year subsample among those with other psychotic disorders. **Those with psychotic disorders other than schizophrenia were more likely to experience stable remission (10.9%) and stable recovery (23.6%), than those with schizophrenia, where these outcomes were rare (0% and 0.7%, respectively)**. Table 4 summarizes demographic predictors of remission and recovery. The upper half of the table reports the association between demographic factors and trajectories of recovery for the baseline sample of 628 participants recruited at first admission. Participants were described themselves as white were more than 4 times as likely to be in the “stable recovery” group, and half as likely to be in the “no recovery” group. Conversely, participants who described themselves as male were less than half as likely to be in the “stable recovery” group, and more than twice as likely to be in the “no recovery” group. Participants from a higher socioeconomic background were 1.3 times more likely to be in the “stable recovery” group, 1.1 times more likely to be in the “other recovery” group, and less likely to be in the “no recovery” group. 表3总结了诊断为精神分裂症（左）和其他精神疾病（右）的患者的缓解和恢复模式。在精神分裂症患者中，基线样本中最常见的模式是无缓解和无恢复的轨迹。这也是在25年的子样本中观察到的精神分裂症患者的模态模式。在那些精神障碍的基线样本中，模态模式是间歇性缓解和恢复之一。在25岁的子样本中，在患有其他精神障碍的患者中观察到了相同的模式。与精神分裂症患者相比，精神分裂症以外的精神疾病患者更可能出现稳定缓解（10.9%）和稳定恢复（23.6%），这些结局罕见（分别为0%和0.7%）。表4总结了缓解和恢复的人口统计学预测因素。表的上半部分报告了人口统计学因素与首次入院时招募的628例参与者基线样本的恢复轨迹之间的关联。被描述为白色的参与者在“稳定恢复”组的可能性是4倍多，在“无恢复”组的可能性是一半。相反，那些自称为男性的参与者被分到“稳定恢复”组的可能性不到一半，而被分到“未恢复”组的可能性是前者的两倍多。来自社会经济背景较高的参与者被归入“稳定恢复”组的可能性高1.3倍，被归入“其他恢复”组的可能性高1.1倍，被归入“未恢复”组的可能性较低。

Demographic factors associated with remission are reported in the lower half of Table 4. Patterns of association are very similar to those observed for recovery. Participants who described themselves as white were 9.5 times more likely to experience stable remission than other racial groups, and half as likely to be in the “no remission” group. Male gender was associated with poorer outcomes, as those who identified as male were nearly half as likely to experience “other” remission, and 2.3 times more likely to have no remission. Finally, higher socioeconomic status was a protective factor. Higher  socioeconomic status was associated with increased odds of early remission and intermittent remission and was protective against being in the “no remission” group. 与缓解相关的人口统计学因素见表4的下半部分。相关模式与恢复期观察到的模式非常相似。自称白人的参与者经历稳定缓解的可能性是其他种族群体的9. 5倍，而"无缓解"组的可能性是一半。男性与较差的结果相关，因为那些被确定为男性的患者经历"其他"缓解的可能性接近一半，无缓解的可能性高2.3倍。最后，较高的社会经济地位是一个保护因素。较高的社会经济地位与早期缓解和间歇性缓解的几率增加相关，并对"无缓解"组具有保护作用。

## Discussion
Understanding prognosis is critical to anticipating future public health needs, and to providing clinical care to individuals with psychotic disorders. However, long-term patterns of remission and recovery in psychotic disorders, particularly for individuals reaching late adulthood are unclear. In this cohort of 628 individuals followed for 25 year since first admission for psychosis, we describe the longitudinal course of remission and recovery in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Among those with schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses followed for 25 years, approximately one in four individuals was in a state of recovery or remission through the first decade following first admission, but as of the 25-year follow up, those rates decreased to 13% and 5%, respectively. Among those with other psychotic disorders followed for 25 years, rates of both remission and recovery exceeded 50% through the first 20 years of illness, but fell to 31 and 47% at the 25-year follow-up. Rates of remission and recovery were slightly lower among those in the full baseline cohort diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and slightly higher among those with other psychotic disorders, relative to the same groups observed at the 25-year follow-up. These differences likely reflect the effect of diagnostic shifts. Individuals who were diagnosed with schizophrenia at baseline likely demonstrated more significant impairment prior to admission than individuals who were diagnosed with other psychotic disorders at baseline, but shifted into the schizophrenia group at later time points. 了解预后对预测未来的公共卫生需求和为精神障碍患者提供临床护理至关重要。然而，精神障碍的长期缓解和恢复模式，特别是对于成年晚期的个体，尚不清楚。在这个由628名个体组成的队列中，自首次因精神病入院后随访25年，我们描述了精神分裂症和其他精神疾病缓解和恢复的纵向过程。在随访25年的精神分裂症谱系诊断患者中，**约1/4的患者在首次入院后的前10年处于恢复或缓解状态，但截至25年随访，这两种发生率分别降至13%和5%**。在随访25年的其他精神障碍患者中，疾病前20年的缓解率和恢复率均超过50%，但在25年随访时下降至31%和47%。与25年随访时观察到的相同组相比，在诊断为精神分裂症谱系障碍的完整基线队列中，缓解率和恢复率略低，而在诊断为其他精神疾病的队列中，缓解率和恢复率略高。这些差异可能反映了诊断转变的影响。与基线时诊断为其他精神疾病的个体相比，基线时诊断为精神分裂症的个体在入院前可能表现出更显著的损害，但在随后的时间点转移至精神分裂症组。

The most common trajectory for participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders is one of no remission and no recovery. The stability of symptoms in schizophrenia across the 25-year following first admission indicates more effective treatments are needed for continuous, lifelong support. In addition, adults with psychotic disorders may require increased care as they age. Among those with other psychotic disorders, the most common longitudinal pattern was one in which individuals transition into  and out of remission and recovery. This illuminates the need for more sustained interventions and psychosocial support throughout the life span of people with other psychoses. People with other psychotic disorders may benefit from regular monitoring and engagement with the health care system even during periods of remission and recovery, to detect the return of symptoms. 精神分裂症谱系障碍参与者最常见的轨迹是无缓解和无恢复。精神分裂症患者首次入院后25年内症状的稳定性表明需要更有效的治疗来获得持续的终身支持。此外，随着年龄的增长，患有精神障碍的成年人可能需要更多的护理。在其他精神障碍患者中，最常见的纵向模式是个体进入和退出缓解和恢复。这说明在其他精神病患者的整个生命周期中需要更持续的干预和心理社会支持。患有其他精神障碍的人可能受益于定期监测和参与度卫生保健系统，即使是在缓解和恢复期间，以检测症状的恢复。

Cross-sectional rates of recovery were higher than rates of remission at almost every follow-up. This is somewhat counterintuitive, as remission reflects only the presence or absence of symptoms, while recovery reflects both symptoms and functioning. An individual may therefore be in remission but not recovery, if their symptoms are mild but they continue to be functionally impaired. However, Andreasen’s (2005) definition of remission was intended to align with concepts of remission in other areas of medicine, for other chronic illnesses, which requires a minimal burden of symptoms. Recovery as defined by Liberman (2005) was intended to provide an alternative to the view of schizophrenia as a hopeless illness, and an achievable target for clinical research. These results indicate that while most individuals with schizophrenia have a significant burden of symptoms through most of the course of illness, many achieve a state of recovery. 几乎在每次随访时，**横断面恢复率均高于缓解率**。这有点违反直觉，因为**缓解只反映了症状的存在或不存在，而恢复则反映了症状和功能**。因此，如果症状轻微但功能继续受损，则个体可能处于缓解状态但未恢复。然而，Andreasen（2005）对缓解的定义是为了与其他医学领域的缓解概念保持一致，对于其他慢性疾病，缓解需要最小的症状负担。Liberman（2005）定义的恢复旨在为精神分裂症作为一种无望的疾病的观点提供一种替代方案，并为临床研究提供一个可实现的目标。这些结果表明，虽然大多数精神分裂症患者在病程的大部分时间里都有明显的症状负担，但许多人都达到了康复状态。

These results contrast with Ciompi’s (1980) finding that approximately half of people with schizophrenia were completely recovered or had only mild symptoms at long-term follow-up, and only 12% of individuals had a chronic course of illness. In the Suffolk County Cohort, 50% of individuals chronic course. This may be attributable to attrition, as only 18% of individuals with schizophrenia were observed included in Ciompi’s analysis of course, whereas the present analyses include a majority (89%) of those individuals with schizophrenia ascertained at baseline. DOSMeD (Harrison et al., 2001) also observed more favorable outcomes, but DOSMeD followed an international cohort, and individuals with schizophrenia from developing countries tend to have better outcomes (Hopper & Wanderling, 2000). The AESOP study (Morgan et al., 2014), like the Suffolk County Mental Health Project a first episode epidemiological sample, reported 29% of participants had continuous symptoms and never reach a state  of remission, compared to our 58% in no remission. These results are more favorite than ours and could be a product of the study being a shorter 10-year follow-up. The sample is also from the United Kingdom, where healthcare is more accessible. Of known first-episode psychosis cohorts, our findings most closely mirror those from the OPUS study (Austin et al., 2013), which identified **low cross-sectional rates of remission and recovery, and high rates of transition between states**. These results are consistent with earlier analyses of individuals in the Suffolk County Project Cohort with bipolar disorder. During the 6-24-month follow-up, an analysis found that younger and non-white participants were less likely to experience complete remission (Craig et al., 2004). During the 48-month follow-up, the majority of participants with nonaffective psychosis experienced recovery, but then almost half experienced relapse – revealing that recovery is unstable (Bromet et al., 2005, 2011; Naz et al., 2007). 这些结果与Ciompi（1980）的发现形成对比，Ciompi（1980）发现，在长期随访中，约一半的精神分裂症患者完全康复或仅出现轻度症状，仅12%的个体有慢性病程。在萨福克郡队列中，50%的个体为慢性病程。这可能归因于损耗，因为仅观察到18%的精神分裂症个体被纳入Ciompi的分析中，而本分析包括大多数（89%）基线时确定的精神分裂症个体。DOSMeD（Harrison等人，2001）也观察到了更有利的结果，但DOSMeD跟踪了一个国际队列，来自发展中国家的精神分裂症患者往往有更好的结果（Hopper & Wanderling，2000）。AESOP研究（Morgan等人，2014），像萨福克郡心理健康项目的首次发病流行病学样本，报告29%的参与者有持续的症状，从未达到缓解状态，而我们的58%在没有缓解。这些结果比我们的结果更受欢迎，可能是10年随访时间较短的研究结果。样本也来自英国，那里的医疗保健更容易获得。在已知的首发精神病队列中，我们的发现最接近OPUS研究的结果（Austin et al.，2013年），该研究确定了较低的缓解率和恢复率，以及较高的状态转换率。这些结果与萨福克郡双相情感障碍项目队列中早期个体分析一致。在6 - 24个月的随访期间，分析发现**年轻和非白人参与者不太可能经历完全缓解**（Craig等人，2004年）。在48个月的随访期间，大多数**非情感性精神病参与者经历了康复，但随后几乎一半经历了复发-表明康复是不稳定的**（Bromet等人，2005年、2011年; Naz等人，2007年）。

These analyses are limited by the length of follow-up intervals, which vary from 6-months to 10 years. This prevented the quantification of how often or quickly people move in and out of remission or recovery. Our analysis is also limited by attrition over each wave of the study. However, retention was relatively high (70%), and imputed data allowed for the comparison of complete and incomplete cases. 这些分析受到随访间隔时间的限制，从6个月到10年不等。这妨碍了人们进入和退出缓解或恢复的频率或速度的量化。我们的分析还受到研究各波损耗的限制。然而，保留率相对较高（70%），插补数据允许对完整和不完整病例进行比较。Sustained, long-term care is critical for individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorder and other psychoses. Though people with other psychoses often have periods of remission and recovery, the model longitudinal pattern is one of multiple episodes. Engagement in a long-term health care plan may help individuals detect and respond to these changes. People with schizophrenia spectrum disorder do not typically recover or remit, and efforts should be put towards ensuring continual access to care, especially as they enter old age. 持续、长期护理对精神分裂症谱系障碍和其他精神病患者至关重要。虽然患有其他精神病的人通常有缓解期和恢复期，但纵向模式是多次发作。参与度长期医疗保健计划可能有助于个人发现和应对这些变化。精神分裂症谱系障碍患者通常不会康复或缓解，应努力确保持续获得护理，特别是在他们进入老年时。


# Is Tapping on Acupuncture Points an Active Ingredient in Emotional Freedom Techniques? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Comparative Studies 
**Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFTs)** combine elements of *cognitive restructuring* and *exposure* techniques with *acupoint stimulation*. Meta-analyses indicate large effect sizes for posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety; however, treatment effects may be due to components EFT shares with other therapies. This analysis reviewed whether **EFTs acupressure component** was an active ingredient. Six studies of adults with diagnosed or self-identified psychological or physical symptoms were compared (n = 403), and three (n= 102) were identified. Pretest vs. posttest EFT treatment showed a large effect size, Cohen's d = 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 2.00) and Hedges' g = 1.25 (95% CI, 0.54 to 1.96). Acupressure groups demonstrated moderately stronger outcomes than controls, with weighted posttreatment effect sizes ofd= −0.47 (95% CI, −0.94 to 0.0) and g = −0.45 (95% CI, −0.91 to 0.0). Meta-analysis indicated that the acupressure component was an active ingredient and outcomes were not due solely to placebo, nonspecific effects of any therapy, or nonacupressure components. 情感自由技术(EFTs)结合了认知重组和暴露技术与穴位刺激的元素。元分析表明，创伤后应激障碍、抑郁和焦虑的效应量较大;然而，治疗效果可能是由于EFT与其他疗法的共同成分。本分析回顾了EFTs指压成分是否是一种有效成分。对6项有诊断或自我确认的心理或身体症状的成人研究进行了比较(n= 403)，确定了3项(n= 102)。试验前与试验后EFT治疗的效应量较大，Cohen's d = 1.28(95%可信区间[CI]， 0.56 - 2.00)， Hedges' g = 1.25 (95% CI, 0.54 - 1.96)。指压组比对照组表现出较强的结果，加权治疗后效应量d=−0.47 (95% CI，−0.94至0.0)和g =−0.45 (95% CI，−0.91至0.0)。荟萃分析表明，指压成分是一种有效成分，结果并不仅仅是由于安慰剂，任何治疗的非特异性效应，或非指压成分。

Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFTs) and other “energy psychology” protocols combine elements of established therapies, such as cognitive restructuring and exposure techniques, with the novel ingredient of acupuncture point (acupoint) stimulation (Gallo, 2004). Acupoint stimulation is delivered in the form of **percussion敲击 with the fingertips (“acupoint tapping”)**, a type of acupressure. In acupressure, the same discrete points on the body that are used in acupuncture are manually stimulated for therapeutic effects (Au et al., 2015). Although the term “acupressure” evokes an image of continual pressure, **tapping on acupoints** is another established way of stimulating them and has been used in methods such as qigong and shiatsu for centuries (Jahnke et al., 2010). For a small proportion of individuals who might find tapping on their skin unsettling, such as those who have been physically abused, an alternative way of stimulating the acupoints within an energy psychology framework is to apply light pressure with the fingertips (Diepold, 2000).  

**Acupoint stimulation can take many forms**, including *acupuncture*, *acupressure*, and *electroacupuncture*. Acupuncture involves the insertion of thin needles into specific acupoints, while acupressure involves applying pressure to these points using the fingers, hands, or other tools. Electroacupuncture is a form of acupuncture that uses a small electric current to stimulate the acupoints.

While stimulating these acupoints, clients maintain mental focus on a traumatic event. This is facilitated by EFT's “setup statement,” which combines exposure with cognitive reframing. The client uses the words “even though” before the triggering phrase, and “I deeply and completely accept myself” after it. A typical setup statement might be, “Even though I was so badly hurt in that terrible car crash, I deeply and completely accept myself.” Although tapping on seven prescribed  acupoints, the client then uses a “reminder phrase” to facilitate exposure. An example of a reminder phrase is “that terrible car crash.” The purpose ofthis study is to investigatewhether the acupressure component is an active ingredient in the effects measured in studies ofEFT. 在刺激这些穴位的同时，病人保持精神集中在创伤性事件上。这得益于EFT的“设置声明”，它将暴露与认知重构结合在一起。在触发词之前，客户使用“even though”，在触发词之后，客户使用“I deep and completely accept myself”。一个典型的开场白可能是，“尽管我在那场可怕的车祸中受了重伤，我还是深深地、完全地接受了自己。”尽管要叩击七个指定的穴位，客户还是会使用一个“提示词”来促进接触。提醒短语的一个例子是“那场可怕的车祸”。“这项研究的目的是调查穴位按压成分是否在feft研究中所测量的效果中是一种有效成分。

Since the publication of a preliminary review of efficacy evidence for acupoint tapping protocols that target psychological concerns (Feinstein, 2008a), more than 50 peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown favorable clinical outcomes (see online research bibliography at research.EFTuniverse.com). Three meta-analyses have found large effect sizes for EFT in the treatment of anxiety (Clond, 2016), depression (Nelms and Castel, 2016), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Sebastian and Nelms, 2017), respectively. A fourth, combining a range of conditions, showed a medium effect size (Gilomen and Lee, 2015). EFT treatment outcomes with PTSD have been particularly encouraging (Church andFeinstein, 2017; Church et al., 2009, 2013, 2016a; Feinstein, 2008b, 2010; Gallo, 2007; Geronilla et al., 2016; Karatzias et al., 2011). Additional studies show rapid improvements for a variety of other psychological challenges such as performance blocks, excessive food cravings, and stress management (see summaries in Church, 2013b; Gallo, 2002, 2004; Mollon, 2007; Schulz, 2009). 自从针对心理问题的穴位叩击疗法疗效证据的初步综述发表以来(Feinstein, 2008a)，超过50个同行评审的随机对照试验(rct)显示了良好的临床结果(参见research.EFTuniverse.com的在线研究参考文献)。三项meta分析分别发现，**EFT在治疗焦虑、抑郁和创伤后应激障碍(PTSD) 方面有较大的效应量**。第四，结合一系列条件，显示了中等效应大小(Gilomen和Lee, 2015)。创伤后应激障碍的EFT治疗结果尤其令人鼓舞。其他的研究表明，对其他各种心理挑战的快速改善，如表现障碍、过度的食物渴望和压力管理。

A range ofmedical diagnoses have also responded favorably to EFT treatment, including fibromyalgia (Brattberg, 2008; Church, 2013c), hypertension (Bach et al., 2016), frozen shoulder (Church and Nelms, 2016), psoriasis (Hodge and Jurgens, 2011), tension headaches (Bougea et al., 2013), pain (Church, 2014; Church and Brooks, 2010; Ortner, 2015), obesity (Stapleton et al., 2012, 2016), traumatic brain injury (Church and Brooks, 2014), and seizure disorders (Swingle, 2010). The demonstrated ability ofEFT to treat this disparate range ofpsychological and physiological conditions has been attributed to the technique's capacity to rapidly reduce stress levels (Church et al., 2012; Lane, 2009) combined with its postulated strengths for facilitating the adaptive processing ofemotional information (Feinstein, 2015).  **一系列的医学诊断也对EFT治疗反应良好，包括纤维肌痛**(Brattberg, 2008;Church, 2013年3月)，高血压(Bach et al.， 2016)，肩周炎(Church and Nelms, 2016)，银屑病(Hodge and Jurgens, 2011)，紧张性头痛(Bougea et al.， 2013)，疼痛(Church, 2014;Church and Brooks, 2010;Ortner, 2015)、肥胖(Stapleton et al.， 2012, 2016)、创伤性脑损伤(Church and Brooks, 2014)和癫痫症(Swingle, 2010)。feft治疗这种不同的心理和生理状况的能力被证明是由于该技术能够快速降低压力水平(Church et al.， 2012;Lane, 2009)结合了其促进情绪信息适应性处理的假定优势(Feinstein, 2015)。

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography scans have investigated neurological shifts after acupoint stimulation. In a 10-year research program conducted at Harvard Medical School, brain imaging experiments showed that the needling or electronic stimulation of specified acupoints consistently produced prominent decreases of activation in the amygdala, hippocampus, and other brain areas associated with fear and pain (Fang et al., 2009; Hui et al., 2005; Napadow et al., 2007). Clinically favorable shifts after acupoint tapping sessions have also been reported for a number ofbiomarkers, including stress hormones (Church et al., 2012), gene expression (Church et al., 2016b; Feinstein and Church, 2010; Maharaj, 2016), electroencephalogram activity (Lambrou et al., 2003; Swingle et al., 2004),  and fMRI-detected brain activation patterns (Gaesser and Karan, 2017). For instance, in an Australian study, 15 obese adult patients selfadministered an EFT protocol at regular intervals over a 4-week period (Stapleton, 2017). Foods that activated areas of the brain associated with hunger and craving before the program produced less activation in those areas at the end of the program, as shown by fMRI. This decreased activation corresponded with a diminished desire for those foods. A wide range of physiological mechanisms, including epigenetic, endocrinal, and neurological components, have thus been found to be associated with EFT treatment. 功能磁共振成像(fMRI)和正电子发射断层扫描已经研究了穴位刺激后的神经转移。在哈佛医学院进行的一项为期10年的研究项目中，大脑成像实验表明，**针刺或电子刺激特定的穴位会持续显著降低杏仁核、海马体和其他与恐惧和疼痛相关的大脑区域的激活度**。穴位叩击过程后的临床有利转变也被报道了许多生物标志物，包括应激激素(Church et al.， 2012)、基因表达(Church et al.， 2016b;范斯坦和丘奇，2010;Maharaj, 2016)，脑电图活动(Lambrou等人，2003;Swingle等人，2004)，以及fmri检测大脑激活模式(Gaesser和Karan, 2017)。例如，在澳大利亚的一项研究中，15名肥胖成年患者在4周的周期内定期自行实施EFT方案(Stapleton, 2017)。功能磁共振成像(fMRI)显示，在项目开始前，食物激活了大脑中与饥饿和渴望相关的区域，但在项目结束时，这些区域的激活程度降低了。这种激活的减少与对这些食物的欲望的减少相对应。**广泛的生理机制，包括表观遗传，内分泌和神经成分，因此已发现与EFT治疗相关**。

Because EFT protocols include elements of psychotherapies that have proven to be efficacious (e.g., cognitive reframing and imaginal exposure), what is the evidence that the strong treatment effects found in EFT clinical trials is not due solely to these ingredients, and not to acupressure (Bakker, 2013; McCaslin, 2009)? Is the acupressure component of EFT an instance of the “**purple hat fallacy**” *紫帽谬误是一种逻辑谬误，当有人认为一个想法或概念是真实的，仅仅因为它没有被证明是假的时候，就会出现这种谬误。这种谬误基于缺乏证据就是证据缺乏的思想，这并不一定正确 absence of evidence is evidence of absence*。(Rosen and Davison, 2003), in which a therapist might apply an efficacious therapeutic method while wearing a purple hat and then attribute the treatment success to the hat? In a critique of the claims of acupoint tapping proponents, Bakker (2014) concluded that **empirical research had “not been able to demonstrate an effect beyond nonspecific or placebo effects, or the incorporation of known-effective elements (p 44)”; that is, that acupressure does not contribute to EFT's effectiveness.** To address this question, Bakker (2013, 2014) and others (Baker et al., 2009; McCaslin, 2009) have recommended that studies be designed to distinguish any effects of acupressure from those of EFT's cognitive, exposure, nonspecific, placebo, and other therapeutic elements. Studies and metaanalyses of other therapies have addressed similar questions, such as whether the eye movements used in eye movement desensitization and reprocessing are a superfluous purple hat or an active therapeutic ingredient (Lee and Cuijpers, 2013). The current analysis examines this question, “Is acupoint tapping an active ingredient in the manualized EFT protocol (Church, 2013a)?” Studies examining this issue were identified in a literature search and assessed for design quality. Those that met predefined quality standards were submitted to meta-analysis. The authors' hypothesis in conducting this study was that EFT protocols which utilize acupoint tapping produce stronger targeted outcomes than comparable protocols that do not use acupressure. 由于**EFT方案包括已被证明有效的心理疗法元素(例如，认知重构和想象暴露)**，有什么证据表明，在EFT临床试验中发现的强大的治疗效果不仅仅是因为这些成分，而不是指压(Bakker, 2013;麦卡斯林，2009)?EFT的指压成分是“紫色帽子谬论”(Rosen和Davison, 2003)的一个实例吗?在这个谬论中，治疗师可能会在戴着紫色帽子的同时应用一种有效的治疗方法，然后将治疗的成功归因于这顶帽子?Bakker(2014)在对穴位叩击支持者主张的批评中得出结论，实证研究“无法证明除了非特异性或安慰剂效应之外的效果，或已知有效元素的结合(第44页)”;也就是说，穴位按压并不有助于EFT的有效性。为了解决这个问题，Bakker(2013, 2014)和其他人(Baker et al.， 2009;McCaslin, 2009)建议研究应将穴位按压的作用与EFT的认知、暴露、非特异性、安慰剂和其他治疗因素的作用区分开来。其他疗法的研究和荟萃分析也提出了类似的问题，例如用于眼动脱敏和再处理的眼动是多余的紫色帽子还是一种有效的治疗成分(Lee和Cuijpers, 2013)。当前的分析探讨了这个问题，“在人工EFT方案中，穴位叩击是一种有效成分吗(Church, 2013a)?“研究这个问题的研究是通过文献检索确定的，并对设计质量进行了评估。那些符合预定质量标准的被提交到荟萃分析。作者在进行这项研究时的假设是，使用穴位叩击的EFT方案比不使用穴位按压的可比方案产生更强的靶向效果。
